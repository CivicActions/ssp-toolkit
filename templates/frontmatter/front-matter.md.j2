## 1. Information System Name

This {{ certification.name }} Framework provide
an overview of the security requirements for the _{{ project.name }}_
(_{{ project.name_short }}_) and describes the controls in place or planned for
implementation to provide a level of security appropriate for the information to
be transmitted, processed, or stored by the system. Information security is vital
to our critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is a
key component of our national security program. Proper management of information
technology (IT) systems is essential to ensure the required risk impact level of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data transmitted,
processed, or stored by the _{{ project.name_short }}_ system is in place and
operating as intended.

The security safeguards implemented for the _{{ project.name_short }}_ system
meet the policy and control requirements set forth in this {{ certification.name }}
Framework. All systems are subject to monitoring, consistent with
applicable laws, regulations, agency policies, procedures, and practices.

## 2. Information System Categorization

The overall _{{ project.name_short }}_ sensitivity categorization is recorded
in Table 2.1, Security Categorization, which follows. The completed FedRAMP
FIPS 199 document is included in this document as Attachment 3 – FedRAMP FIPS
Security Categorization.

### 2.1. Information Types

This section describes how the information types used by
_{{ project.name_short }}_ are categorized for confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of sensitivity levels.

The following tables identify the information types that are input, stored,
processed, and/or output from _{{ project.name_short }}_. The selection of the
information types is based on guidance provided by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Federal Enterprise Architecture (EA) Program Management Office
(PMO) Business Reference Model 2.0, National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199,
Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems,
and NIST Special Publication 800-60 (NIST SP 800-60),
Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories.

FIPS 199[1] allows for a full range of information types. In order to meet
specific, niche needs of systems, Agencies can specify the types of information
being placed in the cloud environment. For {{ certification.name }}, Agencies
can specify the type(s) of information that will reside in {{ certification.name }}
applications/systems.

To be considered a {{ certification.name }} cloud application/service, the
answer to all the following questions must be “yes:”

1. Does the service operate in a cloud environment?
2. Is the cloud service fully operational?
3. Is the cloud service a Software as a Service (SaaS), as defined by
   NIST SP 800-145, The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing?
4. Does the cloud service contain no personally identifiable
   information (PII), except as needed to provide a login capability
   (username, password and email address)?
5. Is the cloud service low-security-impact, as defined by FIPS PUB
   199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information
   and Information Systems?
6. Is the cloud service hosted within a FedRAMP-authorized Platform as
   a Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or is the
   CSP providing the underlying cloud infrastructure?

_{{ project.name_short }}_ System**

### 2.2. Security Objectives Categorization (FIPS 199)

Based on the information provided in Table 2.2, Sensitivity Categorization of
Information Types for the _{{ project.name_short }}_ default to the high-water
mark for the Information Types as identified in Table 2.3, Security Impact
Level, below.

If the security impact level for confidentiality, integrity, and availability
for any of the identified data types is moderate or high, the information
system is not a {{ certification.name }} system. The Cloud
Service Provider (CSP) must meet the standard FedRAMP Low, Moderate, or High
impact baseline security requirements, as applicable, and complete the
requirement documentation.

Table 2‑4. **Security Impact Level**

| **Security Objective**   | **Low, Moderate or High**  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Confidentiality**      | {{ info_sys.security_categorization|title }} |
| **Integrity**            | {{ info_sys.security_categorization|title }} |
| **Availability**         | {{ info_sys.security_categorization|title }} |

Through careful review and analysis, the baseline security categorization for
the _{{ project.name_short }}_ system has been determined and is listed in
Table 2.5, Baseline Security Configuration, which follows.

Table 2‑5. **Baseline Security Configuration**

|                         |      |
|-------------------------|------|
| {{ project.name_short }}| Security Categorization |      | {{ info_sys.security_categorization|title }} |

Using this categorization, in conjunction with the risk assessment and any
unique security requirements, the security controls for this system have been
established as detailed in this {{ certification.name }}
Framework.
