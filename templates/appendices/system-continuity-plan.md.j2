## 1 Overview

{{ sections.overview }}

### 1.1 Introduction

The purpose of the {{ coop.title }} ({{ coop.title_short }}) is to prepare for and address the elements
necessary to sustain {{ project.name_short }} mission essential functions (MEF) at an alternate site and
performing those functions for up to 30 days before returning to normal operations. Once a particular
emergency is resolved, a synopsis of the problem and the resolution process in the form of a “lessons learned”
document is generated and disseminated to all concerned. The {{ coop.title_short }} is intended to serve as
the centralized repository for the information, tasks, and procedures that would be necessary to facilitate
the {{ project.name_short }} management’s decision-making process and its timely response to any disruptive or
extended interruption of normal business operations and services. This is especially important if the cause of
the interruption is such that a prompt resumption of operations cannot be accomplished by employing only normal
daily operating procedures. In terms of personnel and financial resources, the information tasks and procedures
detailed in this plan represent {{ project.name_short }} management’s demonstrated commitment to response,
resumption, recovery, and restoration planning.

### 1.2 Plan Information

The {{ coop.title_short }} consists of dynamic action plans to manage information system operational continuity
objectives, and generally static policy that is managed by organizational processes. For {{ project.name_short }},
the majority of the {{ coop.title_short }} is contained in the action plan, which is captured in the
[{{ project.name_short }} Contingency Plan]({{ project.contingency_plan_url }}) documentation.

## 2 Continuity of Operations Plan Overview

### 2.1 Applicable Provisions and Directives

The development of the {{ project.name_short }} {{ coop.title_short }} is required by both executive decision
and regulatory mandates. The {{ project.name_short }} management must maintain an information assurance (IA)
infrastructure that will ensure that its information resources maintain confidentiality, integrity and
availability of its data and resources. Furthermore, {{ project.name_short }} management must ensure their
strategic information resources management capabilities. Therefore, the {{ project.name_short }}
{{ coop.title_short }} is developed in accordance with the following executive decisions, regulatory mandates,
provisions, and directives as required by:

{% for item in coop.sections.continuity_of_ops.provisions_directives -%}

{% endfor %}
### 2.2 Objectives

{{ coop.sections.continuity_of_ops.objectives }}

### 2.3 Organization

{{ coop.sections.continuity_of_ops.organization.description }}

{% for item in coop.sections.continuity_of_ops.organization.duties -%}
- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}
### 2.4 Assumptions

System recovery time of 24 hours has been determined to provide a cost of recovery consummate with the value
of the functionality provided by {{ project.name_short }}. In light of this schedule, full system recovery can
occur within the time frame, sparing the cost of a “hot” or “warm” site.

### 2.5 Critical Success Factors and Issues

{{ coop.sections.continuity_of_ops.success_factors }}
### 2.6 Mission-Critical Systems/Applications/Services

The following mission-critical systems/applications/services must be recovered at the time of disaster in the
following order, due to interdependencies.

### 3.2 Vital Records/Documentation

Vital records and important documentation are backed up and stored offsite and include any documents or
documentation that is essential to the operations of an organization, such as personnel records, software
documentation, legal documentation, legislative documentation, benefits documentation, etc. The following
documentation will be available:

- Security related Information Technology (IT) policy & procedure memoranda, circulars, publications
- Complete hardware and software listings
- System testing plans/procedures
- System configuration
- Data backup/restoration procedures

## 4 Testing Procedures

## 5 Recommended Strategies

The following information represents potential strategies for execution and is considered as solutions that
potentially may assist in the continued development of recovery capabilities in a post-disaster situation.

### 5.1 Basic Emergency Response Procedures

The actions set forth as responses to disasters are basic procedures that will be followed immediately prior
to or during an actual contingency event. These procedures are designed to protect life; minimize damage,
injury or disruption; and contribute to timely restart and recovery of the {{project.name_short}} System.
