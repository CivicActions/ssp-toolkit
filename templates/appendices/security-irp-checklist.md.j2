# {{ project.name_short }} Security Incident Response Procedure Checklist

This checklist provides incident response procedures. For more detail, see the
[Security Incident Response Plan](security-irp.md).

## 1. _Breathe_

No one's life is in danger.

## 2. Start documenting

Begin documenting all steps and findings. Documentation makes hand-offs and responder onboarding easier. The
Slack channel [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) is recommended because it is most
widely accessible, but other [communication channels](security-irp.md#communication-channels) may be used.

## 3. Initiate the response

_At this stage, the **First Responder** is usually working alone, and is also the **Incident Commander (IC)**._

### Allocate 5 minutes and determine whether this event is a potential incident or false alarm.

#### Respond accordingly:

##### Potential incident

1. Issue a [broadcast notification](security-irp.md#communications-during-the-initiate-phase) via one or
    more of the following:
    - Slack channel [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}). Use `@channel` to notify
    the {{ project.name_short }} team. This may have been automatic via {{ project.pager }} pager alarms.
    - Email to "on call" system admin: {{ project.escalation_mail }}
    - Email/telephone to
       [{{ contractor.name_short }}/{{ project.name_short }} IR Team]({{ project.contact_sheet.url }})
2. For an incident requiring more than 30 minutes to resolve:
    - Recruit additional IR Team responders via the Slack channel
      [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}).
    - Designate an [**Incident Commander**](security-irp.md#incident-commander) and
      [hand off the IC duties](security-irp.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony).
    More information on [incident response roles and responsibilities](security-irp.md#roles-and-responsibilities):
    - [Responder](security-irp.md#responder)
    - [Incident Commander (IC)](security-irp.md#incident-commander)
    - [Communications Officer (CO)](security-irp.md#communications-officer)

    Use the [_Explicit Handoff Ceremony_](security-irp.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony) when transferring/changing
    roles.

##### False alarm

Conclude the incident. Proceed to [_6. Conclude the incident_](#conclude-the-incident).

## 4. Assess the incident

### IR Team responsibilities

#### Confirm the incident.

1. Gather information, and document your findings.
   - Was the event triggered by an [external dependency](contingency-plan.md#external-dependencies)?
   - Is a system failure causing the disruption?
2. Proceed to the next step for a confirmed incident. (For a false alarm, conclude the incident. Proceed to
    [_6. Conclude the incident_](#conclude-the-incident).)

#### Assess the severity.

Use the [rubric in the IR guide](security-irp.md#incident-severities). ({{ project.name_short }} incidents
are generally "Low severity".)

#### Assess whether to activate the contingency plan

Consider whether Disaster Recovery is required. If so, activate the [contingency plan](contingency-plan.md).

_Reminder: Use the [Explicit Handoff Ceremony](security-irp.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony) when
transferring/changing roles._

### Incident Commander responsibilities

- Post an initial situation report, called a _sitrep_ ([example sitrep](security-irp.md#assess)), to the Slack
    channel [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}). Include a descriptive name, and identify
    the current Incident Commander and Responders.
- Ensure that a {{ project.issue_system }} has been created. This should be done, even if the
    _First Responder/IC_ manages the incident fully, for example, by simply re-starting a service.

## 5. Remediate

### IR Team responsibilities

- Determine the cause, implement a resolution, and return the system to normal operations. Make every attempt
    to identify the cause; this can prevent incident recurrence.

- If suspicious activity is suspected or other unanswered questions exist, do the following before making any
    changes:

  - Make {{ project.backup_snaps }} of relevant volumes and data.
  - Preserve logs.
  - Take screen captures of anomalous activity that can be used in post-remediation forensic analysis.
  - Consider implementing a containment strategy. For example, reconfigure firewall rules for the affected
    instance to drop all ingress and egress traffic, except from specific IPs like yours, until forensics can
    be performed.

### Incident Commander responsibilities

- Maintain current information in Slack, shared Google Docs files, the {{ project.issue_incident }}, or other
    [communication channels](security-irp.md#communication-channels). Be sure to include:
  - {{ project.name_short }} team leads and members
  - Remediation items and their assignees
- Establish and document work shifts for an incident longer than 3 hours.
- Maintain communications with stakeholders, or designate a _Communications Officer_ via
    [explicit handoff](security-irp.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony).
- Share _sitreps_ on a regular basis:
    - High severity: hourly
    - Medium severity: 2x daily
    - Low severity: daily
- Focus on coordination, not remediation.

## Conclude the incident

Update the {{ project.issue_system }} and set the status to one of the following:

- Confirmed incident: _Ready for QA_
  - False alarm: _Done_

Notify the Slack channel [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) that the incident has been
resolved.

Schedule an [IR Team retrospective](security-irp.md#have-a-team-retrospective). Optional for false alarms.

Share the final _sitrep_ with stakeholders.

Thank everyone for their service.
