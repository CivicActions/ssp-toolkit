## I. Risk definitions

Any software project requires attention to risk management and mitigation. Throughout our projects we
continually assess individual tasks and the project as a whole in terms of risks and mitigation measures to
minimize any consequences a high-risk item could have on time, scope or budget, ultimately reducing the risk
and ensuring transparency around our approach.

**Software and data risk**: Risk is assigned not only to the complexity of a task and related data requirements,
but also to the impact the task has on the future sustainability of the site or a specific feature. We also
evaluate whether the request complies with the _Performance Work Statement_ to identify any risk with
discrepancies.

**Budget risk**: When a task has a low value but a high cost, risk is identified and brought back to the Product
Owner for prioritization consideration. Budget risk is also considered when an estimate for a task was incorrect,
or when the budget was not clearly tied to deliverables or schedule.

**Scope risk**: In scrum, we identify scope at the onset of the sprint, and scope becomes locked during that
duration. If a task cannot be scoped properly due to insufficient information, we request that the risk is
mitigated by first doing an investigation task so that scope can be identified and the value and risk can be
weighted and prioritized for the next sprint.

**Schedule and timeline risk**: When delivering new functionality or improvements, deployment timing can be a
major risk factor, especially when usability is an issue for site users. Risk is also identified if the schedule
is driven by a specific date or if the launch date is not shared with the development team.

**Mitigation Plan**: Measures we will carry out to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of the risk.
Alternatively, we (client & {{ contractor.name_short }}) can decide to accept the risk.

**Indicator**: A marker that we monitor to determine whether the risk is impacting the project.

**Contingency Plan**: The plan we would follow if the risk arises.

## II. Measure risk

**Risk severity**: The severity of a risk is its likelihood multiplied by its impact. Risks are classified
as minor if they have a low likelihood, negligible impact, or medium likelihood and marginal impact.

We typically measure risk as:

- **High**, when additional research and discovery are required before a rational estimate can be made.
- **Medium**, when we know how to achieve the goal but we have clearly identified aspects of development that
- could prove troublesome.
- **Low**, when the task is relatively routine and we know how to address any contingencies.

Again, risk assessment is something that is done at every meeting, and within each ticket, to help keep
development progress on track and to assist in prioritizing functional requirements.

If tasks are identified as both high priority and high risk, we typically address them first in order to
accelerate the discovery of potential problems so that we have enough time to overcome any technical or
organizational obstacles.
