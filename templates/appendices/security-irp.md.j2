## Introduction
This document describes the {{ project.name }} Incident Response Team's process for responding to security incidents and and other disruption that may affect the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) or Privacy of system resources and data. It outlines roles and responsibilities during and after incidents, and it provides an overview of the steps to follow for resolution.

**Note:** During an incident, the [**IRP checklist**](security-irp-checklist.md) may be more useful as it contains bulleted, actionable items to be adressed when an incident is being investigated and remediated.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Basic Incident Response Team roles are described below.

### Responder
A _Responder_ is an {{ project.name }} Incident Response (IR) Team member working to investigate and remediate an event or incident.
- The _First Responder_ is the _first_ IR Team member made aware of the incident (see [Initiate](#initiate) below).
   - Oftentimes the _First Responder_ is also the _reporter_ of the event.
- The _First Responder_ assumes the role of the initial _Incident Commander (IC)_ until that is [handed off](security-irp-checklist.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony).
  - For the first 15-30 minutes, the _First Responder_ (who is also the IC) may be the only _Responder_. If needed, the _First Responder_ begins the process if IR Team formation.

During incident response, _Responders_:
- Assume primary responsibility for the [Assess](#assess) and [Remediate](#remediate) steps.
- Document _in real time_ the measurements, theories, and steps taken using [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) or other channels provided by the IC.
- Designate, with an [explicit hand-off](security-irp-checklist.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony), a dedicated **Incident Commander** if the incident will take longer than 15-30 minutes to resolve.

### Incident Commander (IC)
The _Incident Commander (IC)_ is not involved in the remediation of an incident, and instead performs three major duties:

1. Incident Response Team creation and management, ensuring that the IR Team:
   - Is staffed with people capable of managing the situation
      - For the first 15-30 minutes, the IC may be the only _Responder_.
   - Is focused on the correct goals for incident resolution
   - Has appropriate media/communication channels for recording actions
      - If during business hours, a dedicated slack channel (e.g. `#fire-team) may be created for IR team communications.
   - Utilizes work shifts if the incident lasts longer than 3 hours.
2. Documentation: ensuring that actions taken during investigation and remediation are recorded
   - Initially in the [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) slack channel
   - Also in the {{ project.name_short }} {{ project.issue_system }}
3. Communication: ensuring that internal and external entities are aprised of the situation and progress reports
   - As communications is an important task, the IC may request and designate with [explicit handoff](security-irp-checklist.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony) a dedicated _Communications Officer_ (CO).

### Communications Officer (CO)
Throughout the development of an incident, from receiving an event report to the completion of incident remediation, communications are key.

The _Communications Officer (CO)_ (whose duties are performed by the IC until [handoff](security-irp-checklist.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony) to another IR Team member) manages external communications with:

- Management, developers, users and anyone affected by the incident
- Client stakeholders
  - Escalates communication to additional team members and/or the {{ project.name_short }} Product Owner when needed.
- Legal team and US-CERT escalations if required

#### Communication channels

- Slack: [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) using `@channel` (Notifies the team about the incident.)
  - If during business hours, a dedicated Slack channel (e.g. `#fire-team`) may be created for IR team communications
- A {{ project.name_short }} {{ project.issue_incident }} which will be the final location for all reporting processes, with links to other documents as needed.
- Zoom, Meet, other video chat _(though not a good place for recording actions as a record may be lost when the call ends)_
- Email: {{ project.escalation_mail }} (Alerts the "on call" responder(s).)
- [{{ contractor.name_short }}/{{ project.name_short }} IR Team contacts]({{ project.contact_sheet_url }}) (Provides direct email addresses and phone numbers.)

## Incident response process

There are four major processes of incident response, detailed below. See the [IRP checklist](security-irp-checklist.md) for quick, actionable information to use durin an incident.

### Initiate

An incident begins when someone becomes aware of a disruption in expected normal system operations. We define "incident" broadly, following [_NIST SP 800-61: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide_](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final), as "a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices". This is a deliberately broad definition, designed to encompass any scenario that might threaten the security of the {{ project.name }}. For more, see: [What is an incident?](http://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incidents/#what-is-an-incident)

When a person (the _reporter_) notices what appears to be a {{ project.name_short }}-related event, they should check normal communication channels -- if possible -- such as Slack ([#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }})) to see if this may be expected behavior (e.g., expected system downtime during a maintenance window). If it appears to be a valid incident, the _reporter_ alerts the on-call responders via Slack ([#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }})) or email {{ project.escalation_mail }}. If there is no acknowledgment from the Incident Response Team within 10 minutes, the reporter should escalate the issue by contacting team members on the {{ project.contact_sheet }} directly until receiving acknowledgment of the report.

The _First Responder_ on the {{ project.name }} Incident Response Team is by default also the initial _Incident Commander_ (IC). The _First Responder/IC_ does the following:
- If possible, confirms the event (report of system degradation or other disruption of normal service).
- Remains IC unless and until an an [explicit handoff](security-irp-checklist.md#explicit-handoff-ceremony) transfers IC duties to another IR Team member.
- Communicates to the {{ project.short_name }} team that an event has been reported and is under investigation.

In some cases, the _First Responder/IC_ may be able to fully manage the incident, perhaps by simply re-starting a service.
- A {{ project.issue_incident }} should still be created and completed describing the incident and including downtime.

#### Communications during the Initiate phase

Note that at this point the event status is "investigating". The issue has not been confirmed yet, so it should be called an "event". When it has been confirmed, it becomes an "incident".

To initiate the reporting process, the _First Responder/IC_ sends notification to the {{ project.short_name }} team preferably via a real-time chat such as Slack: [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) using `@channel`
- This may have been done automatically via {{ project.pager }} pager alarms
- Example message follows. _(The format is not important, but the information fields are useful.)_
   - **Description**: _[Short description of the event and its impact]_
   - **Status**: **investigating**
   - **Severity**: **unknown**
   - **Reporter**: _[name of the person who reported the issue]_
   - **IC**: _[your name]_
   - **Responders**: _[names of other responders]_
   - **Details**: _[Any extra details about the event can go here.]_

The IC -- who may change during the course of the incident -- is responsible for keeping this issue updated as investigation and remediation progresses. 

### Assess

The next step is to assess the event. The IC forms an _Incident Response Team_ of _Responders_ to answer two questions:

1. Is the reported event an incident?
   - Did the thing we suspect happened actually happen? Or is it a [false alarm](security-irp-checklist.md#false-alarm)?
   - Could the event have been triggered by an [external dependency](contingency-plan.md#external-dependencies)?
2. How severe is the incident?
   - [Assesses the severity](#incident-severities) of the incident. This determines the resources required for response.
   - Does it affect system or data Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and/or Privacy?
   - Note that severity can change over the lifespan of an incident, and it is acceptable for the team to assess the initial severity quickly.

If the event is determined to be a [false alarm](security-irp-checklist.md#false-alarm), the IC should update the ticket, set the status to "false alarm", and close the ticket.

The IC should assess whether Disaster Recovery may be required in which case the [contingency plan](contingency-plan.md) should be activated.

#### Communications during the Assess phase

_Responders_ record all actions and observations in one of the supplied [communications channels](#communications-channels).

Once assessed, the IC updates the reported event and notes at least the following:
- **Status**: **confirmed**
- **Severity**: _[High/Med/Low]_
- **Responders**: _[update to include names of new/changed responders]_

The IC creates an initial incident report, called a _sitrep_, in a {{ project.issue_incident }}, summarizing the incident details. Here is an example sitrep:
- **Subject:** [sitrep] The chickens are escaping
- **Severity:** low
- **IC:** Farmer Jane
- **Responders:** Spot the Dog, Farmer Dave
- **Description:** We've confirmed reports of escaped chickens. Looks like a fox may have tunneled into the run. Dave is working to fix the fence. Spot is tracking the fox.

This sitrep should be posted in:
- {{ project.issue_system }}
- Slack channel [#{{ project.slack_channel }}]({{ project.slack_url }}) (include link to {{ project.issue_incident }})
- and/or whatever [communications channel](#communications-channels) the IC (or CO) has indicated.

### Remediate

Remediation is about resolving the issues caused by an incident. Remediation will be situation-specific, and timelines vary based on the assessed severity. Here are a few guidelines:

_Responder_ actions:

- The IR Team will develop a list of informational leads from the incident — actionable information about any security breaches, stolen data, etc. Similarly, the IR Team will develop a list of remediation steps. These can be tracked as checklists in the {{ project.issue_incident }}.
- If suspicious activity is suspected or other unanswered questions exist, create database dumps, take disk snapshots of relevant volumes, reconfigure firewalls to prevent ingress and egress, and/or get screen captures of anomalous activity _before making changes_ to support post-remediation forensic analysis.

_Incident Commander_ actions:

- The IC's responsibility is coordination, communication, and information collection. While the remediation team is focused on resolving the issue, the IC must track what happened, how the incident is being remediated, and who is part of those efforts.
- The IC is responsible for tracking remediation actions, making sure they are assigned and followed, and verifying them when they are completed. Remediation efforts may be tracked with the issue details. 
- The IC should distinguish between immediate concerns, which need to be completed before the incident is considered resolved, and long-term improvements/hardening, which can be deferred to the Retrospective.
- Ideally the notes that the IC makes should be sufficient for an outside investigator to independently follow the work of the Incident Response Team and validate the team's work.

#### Communications during the Remediate phase

If and when appropriate, the _Incident Commander_ (IC) or _Communications Officer_ (CO)
- Coordinates with the {{ contractor.name_short }} managers to apprise them of the situation.
- Coordinates with the {{ project.name}} Product Owner (PO) to notify affected customers.
- Ensure that the IR Team is recording all actions in the approriate designated [communications channels](#communications-channels).
- Share sitreps on a regular basis in Slack, in the {{ project.issue_incident }}, and with stakeholders.
   - See the section on [incident severities](#incident-severities) for suggested time intervals for each severity level.

#### Remediation process notes

Remediation may require service disruption. If it does, the team should proceed in a different way depending on the [severity](#incident-severities):
- High-severity: Take action immediately, even if this causes disruption. A notification about the disruption should be sent out as soon as possible, but the team needs no permission to take action at this level.
- Medium-severity: Notify the {{ project.name_short }} leads of the planned action, and help them assess the relative risk of disruption versus security. If the leads are unavailable on Slack, contact them using the phone numbers in their Slack profiles. The team should reach a collaborative decision on action, with a bias towards disruption. If they cannot be reached within an hour, the team may take action without them.
- Low-severity: Notify the leads as described above. Do not take action until a mutually-agreed course of action has been determined.

Remediation takes time. If the issue progresses for more than 3 hours without being resolved, the IC should plan for a long remediation. This means:
- Determine whether remediation efforts will occur during business hours only or be continuous. This depends on the severity of the issue, and whether breaches are ongoing.
- For a continuous response, the IC should plan shifts. This allows responders to take breaks and insures continuous coverage. Shifts should be no longer than 3 hours. Also, the IC duties should rotate in shifts no longer than 3 hours.

When the incident is no longer active -- for example, the breach has been contained, the issue has been fixed, etc. -- the IC should close out the incident. There might be longer term remediation required, and possibly more investigation, but when the incident is no longer active, these activities can proceed at the regular pace of business.

To close out an incident, the IC should:

- Set the status of the incident to **Ready for QA**.
- Send a final sitrep to stakeholders.
- Thank everyone involved for their service.

### Retrospect

The responding team holds a retrospective to analyze the incident, capture follow-ups and lessons learned, and write a formal report.

Before this process begins, the Incident Commander (IC) should ensure that all relevant information is either copied or linked to the {{ project.issue_system }} created during the Assessment phase.

The final step in handling a security incident is identifying what can be learned from it. The IC (or one of the ICs if there were multiple, or a designated other party such as the Communications Officer) should lead a retrospective and develop an incident report.

The incident report should contain:

- a timeline of the incident
- details about how the incident progressed
- information about the vulnerabilities that led to the incident, also called a _cause analysis_

The _cause analysis_ is an important part of the incident report. Tools such as [Infinite Hows](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2014/11/14/the-infinite-hows-or-the-dangers-of-the-five-whys/) and [Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) can help the team explore potential causes, prevention, and improved incident response.

The incident report should contain these basic response metrics:
- Discovery method: How did the team become aware of the issue?
- Time to discovery: How much time passed from the time the incident became active until someone became aware of it?
- Time to containment: How much time passed from the time someone became aware of the incident until the incident was contained?
- Threat actions: What actions were taken by the actor? For example, phishing, password attacks, etc.

The incident report should be posted as a final comment on the {{ project.issue_system }}, which can then be closed.

## Incident severities

The incident severity level determines the actions of the Incident Response Team. Severity usually changes during the lifecycle of the incident.

### High severity

A high severity incident compromises the confidentiality/integrity of Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII), impacts the availability of services for a large number of customers, or has significant financial impact. Examples include:

- Confirmed breach of SPII
- Successful root-level compromise of production systems
- Denial of Service attacks resulting in severe outages

Guidelines for incident response:

- Remediation efforts will likely be continuous until the issue is contained.
- Responders may take any action required to contain the issue, including complete service degradation.
- Sitreps should be shared every hour, or more frequently.

### Medium severity

A medium severity incident can be an unsuccessful attempt to breach Personally Identifiable Information (PII), an event with limited impact on the availability of services for a large number of customers, or an event with limited financial impact. Examples include:

- Suspected PII breach
- Targeted but unsuccessful attempts to compromise production systems
- Spam/phishing attacks targeting {{ contractor.name_short }} or {{ project.name_short }} staff
- Denial of Service attacks resulting in limited service degradation

Guidelines for incident response:

- Response should occur during business hours.
- Responders should attempt to consult stakeholders before causing downtime, but may proceed without consent if stakeholders do not respond in a reasonable time frame.
- Sitreps should be shared approximately twice per day.

### Low severity

A low severity incident does not affect PII, and has no availability or financial impact. Examples include:

- Attempted compromise of non-important systems, for example, staging or testing instances
- Denial of Service attacks with no noticeable customer impact

Guidelines for incident response:

- Response should occur during business hours.
- Responders should avoid service degradation unless stakeholders agree.
- Sitreps should be shared daily.
