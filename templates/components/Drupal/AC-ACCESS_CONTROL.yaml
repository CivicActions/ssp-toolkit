      Drupal provides the following information system account types to support
      organizational mission/business functions:


      - Anonymous user - readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not
        logged in.

      - Authenticated user - All non-anonymous users inherit the "authenticated user role"
        that supports personal account management capabilities.
      
      - Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.

      Drupal defines a default set of roles; Anonymous, Authenticated, and
      Administrator, as well as providing for the creation of additional
      organizational-defined roles identified by {{project.name}}
  - key: d
    text: Drupal has a sophisticated permissions and role-based access control
      built-in. Each role within Drupal can only access the documents and
      controls for which their privilege allows.
  - key: g
    text: Drupal monitors the usage of information accounts in the Watchdog log.

  narrative:
  - text: >
      Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via a unique username/password
      for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions,
      and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.

      The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
      does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal
      Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.

  narrative:
  - key: a
    text: Drupal can be configured to lock an account after a specified number of
      invalid login attempts within a specified time period. The default for Drupal is 5
      failed login attempts within six hours.
  - key: b
    text: Lockdown following unsuccessful attempts is configurable by Drupal administrators
      to conform to defined requirements. When a user exceeds the limit of invalid
      login attempts, their account is automatically locked for a specified time and
      requires administrator action to unlock the account before the lockout period
      expires.
