      The logs collected for Drupal sites include the following types of information:


      - IP number of the request originator

      - Timestamp

      - Request URL

      - HTTP status code returned

      - Username

      - Drupal Watchdog message (if applicable)

      - Unique numerical ID of the content being modified (for content creation, modification and deletion
        events)

      When auditing a Drupal incident, the {{contractor.name_short}} developers aggregate log
      sources from multiple servers into the Graylog dashboard so that all log entries
      for a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document.
      Log sources are sorted, filtered and reviewed. Application logs are maintained
      primarily for an after-the-fact investigation of critical systems or security
      events.
