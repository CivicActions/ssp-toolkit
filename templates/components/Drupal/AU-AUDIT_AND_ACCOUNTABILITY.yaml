      The logs collected for Drupal sites include the following types of information:

      * IP number of the request originator

      * Timestamp

      * Request URL

      * HTTP status code returned

      * Username

      * Drupal Watchdog message (if applicable)

      * Unique numerical ID of the content being modified (for content creation, modification
      and deletion events)

      When auditing a Drupal incident, the {{contractor.name_short}} developers aggregate log
      sources from multiple servers into the Graylog dashboard so that all log entries
      for a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document.
      Log sources are sorted, filtered and reviewed.  Application logs are maintained
      primarily for an after-the-fact investigation of critical systems or security
      events.
