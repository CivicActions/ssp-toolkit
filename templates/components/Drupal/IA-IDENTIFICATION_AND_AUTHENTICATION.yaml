      Drupal users authenticate using the standard login protocol prior to using application
      services. User roles are described in AC-3.

      Privileged Drupal accounts can only be created by existing website users with
      the role of "administrator". Administrator users assign roles to each login
      account that governs the user's ability to create, publish, update or delete
      website content.

    text: Drupal requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the
      application website enforces this. User accounts are assigned a randomly-generated
      and unguessable default password that is not shared with anyone, including site
      Administrators. Once the user logs in and creates a new password, the default
      password erased from the website's database.

      even if the website's database should be compromised, an attacker would still
      be unable to know users' actual passwords. Internal users receive training in
      security awareness and acceptable use and are instructed never to reveal their
      passwords to anyone.

      • Not listing passwords in tickets

      Drupal supports the requirement for password-based authentication complexity.
      New users of Drupal are required to specify their password authentication as
      soon as they log in to the website for the first.  The website requires all
      submitted passwords to comply with validation rules, as described above in IA-5(c).

      Changing password lifetime, length, reuse or strength requirements requires a code
      setting change that therefore needs to be planned and approved by
      {{contractor.name_short}} Change Control Board before being implemented.
