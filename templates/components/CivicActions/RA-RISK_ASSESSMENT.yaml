      CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a risk
      assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
      procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.
      This information is maintained in the CivicActions Risk Assessment (RA) Policy
      and Procedure CivicActions that can be found in the CivicActions Github repository
      at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.

      CivicActions Operations uses vulnerability scanning software to document and
      determine risks to the system. Operating system and application vulnerability
      scans include:

      • The CivicActions system environment employs the OpenSCAP scanner with the
      Red Hat STIG baseline to check for vulnerabilities.

      • The CivicActions application environment is tested by the penetration tester
      OWASP ZAP, an open-source web application security scanner to report on needed
      updates based on known flaws.

      CivicActions Operations has automated the process to perform the scans on a
      monthly basis. The resulting reports list vulnerabilities and ranks them by
      severity. These reports are stored on an audit server and are used to inform
      changes to the system and verify that security controls are working correctly.  These
      scans are used to document the current state of the system, and to analyze security
      trends as changes are made over time.

      CivicActions uses the automated vulnerability scanning tools OpenSCAP and OWASP
      ZAP are interoperable with standard web browsers, the Open Source Ansible infrastructure
      provisioning system and other Open Source tools employed by CivicActions.

      CivicActions Security reviews all vulnerabilities identified from automated
      scans and security assessments. Vulnerabilities found and deemed legitimate
      are assigned an impact rating and response time thought creation of an issue
      or ticket.  CivicActions Operations reviews current scans and compare with older
      scans to identify trends and to verify previous vulnerabilities have been mitigated.

      Identified and reported vulnerabilities are assigned an impact rating and response time by CivicActions Security and must be remediated according to the following time requirements:
      • High - Within 30 days of discovery (usually within 1 week))
      • Moderate - Within 90 days of discovery (usually within 2 weeks)
      • Low - Within 240 days of discovery

      Results of the vulnerability scans and security assessments are shared with
      all appropriate CivicActions personnel supporting continuous monitoring requirements.
      CivicActions Security assigns each vulnerability an impact rating and response
      time though JIRA or the Git issue tool for tracking to the established remediation
      deadlines listed in RA-5(d).
