      Both regular and ad hoc training to all CivicActions personnel, including those
      who support the system infrastructure and applications, is provided. All employees
      and contractors must complete Security Awareness trainings upon being hired
      and at least annually thereafter. CivicActions Operations will not create accounts
      for individuals until they have successfully completed the trainings. Additional
      training will be provided as required by system changes. Training takes the
      following forms:

      Annual Knowledge Survey (i.e., Security Awareness Training): All employees are
      required to review trainings covering Security Awareness. After the training,
      a survey-style security awareness test is taken by employees. All CivicActions
      personnel are required to complete and pass the survey, and new employees are
      required to pass before being granted access to the Information System. In order
      to successfully pass the test, a score of 80% is required. This survey tests
      CivicActions personnelâ€™s knowledge of critical security subjects, policies and
      procedures. Results from this survey are compiled by the Director of Human Resources
      and used to refine future training efforts.

      Ad Hoc Security Awareness: The CivicActions ISSO oversees the approximately
      bi-monthly distribution of security awareness tips and articles to the all CivicActions
      employees. This can include general tips as well as articles tailored to the
      specific requirements of CivicActions users.
