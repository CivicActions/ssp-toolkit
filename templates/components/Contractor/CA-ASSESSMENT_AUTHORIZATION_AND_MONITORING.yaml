      {{contractor.name_short}} will develop a security assessment plan (SAP)
      that describes the security controls and control enhancements under

      {{contractor.name_short}} will assess the security controls in their
      system and its environment of operation to determine the extent to which
      the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
      producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security
      requirements.


      All controls assigned and documented in this System Security Plan (SSP)
      will be tested at least annually or when there is a major change to the
      system.

      {{contractor.name_short}} documents all deficiencies and vulnerabilities
      identified during the security certification and/or continuous monitoring
      phase (via security assessment, vulnerability scanning, risk assessment,
      etc.) within the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).


      The POA&M document provides a platform for {{contractor.name_short}} to
      monitor and track the deficiency and its mitigation strategy. POA&M items
      will include:


      - The description of the deficiency,

      - Dedicated point of contact for this deficiency.

      - Cost of the mitigation strategy

      - Associated risk and NIST control

      - Recommended mitigation strategy


      POA&Ms are tracked throughout the lifecycle of the system until its
      mitigation. All POA&Ms are reviewed on a monthly basis by
      {{contractor.name_short}} Information System Security Officer to ensure
      all mitigation strategies are continuing as documented.

      {{contractor.name_short}} implements a continuous monitoring strategy
      that incorporates configuration management, system scanning and log
      analysis processes:


      - Configuration management includes the assessment of security impact analyses of proposed and implemented changes.

      - System scanning is managed by running the OpenSCAP vulnerability scanner using the DISA STIG profile.

      - Log analysis is managed by feeding logs to a Graylog dashboard for analysis.

  - key: b
    text: >
      Configuration management and log analysis is carried out in real time.
      OpenSCAP security scans are performed and reviewed monthly. See also:
      RA-5 and SI-4.


      Quarterly review of the control assessments supporting the monitoring is
      conducted by {{contractor.name_short}} Operations in collaboration with the
      {{contractor.name_short}} Security Office.
