      Prospective {{contractor.name_short}} employees undergo background checks

      checks may also be conducted on contractors and/or third party users in
      cases where they will have access to application data that is not meant

    text: >
      Information system access is terminated immediately upon the voluntary or
      involuntary departure of an employee. In the case of involuntary departure,
      in addition to immediate termination of system access, at no point is a
      departing employee allowed access to any part of the
      {{contractor.name_short}} infrastructure.

      In the case of voluntary departure, employees are permitted access to
      the information system for the duration of their offboarding period. The
      departing employee’s manager is responsible for informing the Information
      Technology department when the employee offboarding period concludes. At
      this time system and facility, access is terminated.

      The terminated user’s accounts are disabled and all access associated

      The employee's manager or the Office of Human Resources conducts exit
      interviews with all employees who leave {{contractor.name_short}}
      voluntarily. There is a general discussion about the process of turning

      {{contractor.name_short}} employees provide their own equipment that must
      be hardened to security requirements depending upon their roles and duties.
      {{contractor.name_short}} supplies two-factor authentication tokens that
      become the property of the employee.

      Some employees may receive company-issued hardware for working on
      particular projects. These items are collected before the employee exits
      {{contractor.name_short}}. In the case of an involuntary termination, the
      Office of Human Resources works to collect company-issued devices and
      provides paperwork highlighting confidential protections for customers.

      Access to {{contractor.name_short}} information and information systems is
      always shared so that the termination of an individual will not prevent
      {{contractor.name_short}} from having access to needed resources.

      When a person is terminated, a standard off-boarding process is used to
      notify management and {{contractor.name_short}}' Operations staff, and to
      track the process of disabling access to the information system/information
      system components. The {{contractor.name_short}} Operations staff and
      Security Office are given at least four hours notice to schedule the
      deactivation of access upon termination. Deactivation is a manual process
      that is tracked via a Trello card in order to meet the four hour
      turnaround time before termination.

      When an employee, third party personnel and/or contractor is transferred
      to a new project or position within {{contractor.name_short}}, they may
      maintain access to the previous system they were working on in order to
      facilitate the process of maintenance and knowledge transfer. However, as
      part of the practices of account management (AC-2) and least privilege
      (AC-6), regular audits of privileged users are conducted and access
      privileges may be removed when no longer needed. Additionally, adherence
      to specific client SLAs may enhance the frequency of such audits or the
      timeliness of privilege removal during personnel transfer.

      When an employee, third party personnel and/or contractor is transferred
