      Both regular and ad hoc training to all {{contractor.name_short}}
      personnel, including those who support the system infrastructure and
      applications, is provided. All employees and contractors must complete
      Security Awareness training upon being hired and at least annually
      thereafter. {{contractor.name_short}} Operations staff will not create
      accounts for individuals until they have successfully completed the
      trainings. Additional training will be provided as required by system
      changes. Training takes the following forms:


      Annual Knowledge Survey (i.e., Security Awareness Training): All employees
      are required to review trainings covering Security Awareness. After the
      training, a survey-style security awareness test is taken by employees.
      All {{contractor.name_short}} personnel are required to complete and pass
      the survey, and new employees are required to pass before being granted
      access to the Information System. In order to successfully pass the test,
      a score of 80% is required. This survey tests {{contractor.name_short}}
      personnelâ€™s knowledge of critical security subjects, policies and
      procedures. Results from this survey are compiled by the Office of Human
      Resources and used to refine future training efforts.


      Ad Hoc Security Awareness: The {{contractor.name_short}}' Security Office
      oversees the approximately bi-monthly distribution of security awareness
      tips and articles to all {{contractor.name_short}} employees. This can
      include general tips as well as articles tailored to the specific
      requirements of {{contractor.name_short}} users.
