      {{contractor.name_short}} system administrators employ a personal public-
      key pair for basic access and must originate from a whitelisted IP address.
      The whitelist is maintained by an Ansible inventory file, the current
      complete list (includes dev sites) of users with whitelisted IPs is in
      artifact: {{artifact.inventory_whitelist}}


      To access root (sudo) privileges an additional password is required. The
      passwords are maintained in encrypted form in the Ansible inventory file.
      The mechanism to enable select users to use a password to obtain root
      access can be viewed in artifact: {{artifact.admin_sudo}}

      {{contractor.name_short}} systems employ authentication methods consistent
      with NIST FIPS 140-2 requirements. General public access to system web
      pages does not require cryptographic authentication. Privileged users
      accessing systems use the public-key cryptographic functionality of
      Secure Shell (SSH) to encrypt the exchange of information (including the
      password) between the remote user and the server. Where Transport Layer
      Security (TLS, aka SSL) is used, cryptographic modules will be configured
      in accordance with FIPS 140-2.
