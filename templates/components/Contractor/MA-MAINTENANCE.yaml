      System maintenance is done from remote sites as there is no direct access
      to the server instances in the AWS cloud; this is the government-approved
      method of doing business. Approval, QA, and monitoring are conducted by
      the team performing the specific maintenance.

      Remote diagnostics tools, such as OSSEC, AIDE, fail2ban, and OpenSCAP are
      used to verify the integrity of files, perform log analysis, monitor
      login attempts and check for rootkits and other vulnerabilities.

      All nonlocal maintenance requires the same authentication requirements to
      perform the maintenance activities to access the system as defined in
      controls AC-3 and IA-2. SSH is used to secure all communications between
      the remote user and the components located in the AWS cloud.

      {{contractor.name_short}} records for nonlocal maintenance is managed
      through JIRA tickets and the Git issue queue as well as normal system
      logs. {{contractor.name_short}} administrator activity to the system is
      also logged through the implementation of the AU-2 (Audit Events) and
      AU-3 (Content of Audit Records).

      responsibilities. Access rights for the internal administrators are
      assigned and granted access to perform their specific job responsibilities.
      All physical maintenance requirements are inherited from AWS.
