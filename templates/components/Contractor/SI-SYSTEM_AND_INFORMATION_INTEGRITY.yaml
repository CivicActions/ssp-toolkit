      Identification of information system security flaws are detected as early
      as possible by the following methods:


      - Vulnerability scans, as described in RA-5.

      - Log analysis from monitoring described in SI-4.

      - Service flaw notifications (CVEs, etc.) are received by the
        {{contractor.name_short}} Security Office and passed on to
        CivicActions Operations staff when relevant.

      Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA and/or the Git issue
      queue. {{contractor.name_short}} Operations staff prioritizes high
      findings. Changes made to correct the information system as a result of
      the system flaws are scheduled and coordinated through the CCB Change
      Request Process and appropriate approvals required from the CCB as
      implemented in CM-3.

      {{contractor.name_short}} testing of the system as a result of security
      flaw remediation is done through a development environment through the
      use of internal software and automated testing that ensures the system is
      working as intended. When a change is made by a developer, testing though
      a peer review is conducted as part of the Change Request process to ensure
      the correct analysis is completed. Then the changed code is tested in an
      automatic test environment as described in the Configuration Management
      Plan (CMP). Tracking of the testing is documented in JIRA and/or the Git
      issue queue.

      {{contractor.name_short}} security-software updates are tested prior to
      implementation on production. The {{contractor.name_short}} Security
      framework for installation requires updates to be made within 30 days for
      high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities, and 240 for
      low vulnerabilities. An issue ticket is created to track any updates made
      to the system.

      Real-time scans are conducted whenever files are uploaded from any
      external source and malicious code is blocked or quarantined when detected.
      All file-based traffic traversing the server is sanitized before being
      delivered. All input form text is validated and sanitized.
