    text: >
      {{contractor.name_short}} has developed this system security plan (SSP) for the information
      system as part of compliance with NIST 800-53 and FIPS 199. The SSP defines
      the security categorization, system boundary, and security requirements and
      controls meeting the requirements of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).
      Specifically the SSP:

      1. Is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture

      2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system

      3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions
      and business processes

      4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including
      supporting rationale

      5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships
      with or connections to other information systems

      6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system

      7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable

      8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements
      including a rationale for the tailoring decisions

      9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative
      prior to plan implementation
