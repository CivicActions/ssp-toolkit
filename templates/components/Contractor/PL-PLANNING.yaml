      {{contractor.name_short}} has developed this system security plan (SSP)
      for the information system as part of compliance with NIST 800-53 and FIPS
      199. The SSP defines the security categorization, system boundary, and
      security requirements and controls meeting the requirements of the NIST
      Risk Management Framework (RMF). Specifically the SSP:


      1. Is consistent with the organizationâ€™s enterprise architecture

      2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system

      3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions and business processes

      4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale

      5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or connections to other information systems

      6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system

      7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable

      8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements including a rationale for the tailoring decisions

      9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation

      Owner, Authorizing Official, Information System Security Officer,
      System/Network Administrator, and the {{contractor.name_short}} Operations
      staff. The SSP is maintained by the {{contractor.name_short}} Security
      Office.

      The {{contractor.name_short}} Operations staff in collaboration with the
      {{contractor.name_short}} Security Office updates the system description
      and control descriptions within the SSP as needed to verify the SSP is an

      The SSP is currently available to authorized users on GitLab. Per the
      Acceptable Use Policy, all entities granted access to
      {{contractor.name_short}} information assets are required to complete a
      non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to uphold information confidentiality.
      GitLab provides the configuration management capabilities for the SSP to
      be protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
