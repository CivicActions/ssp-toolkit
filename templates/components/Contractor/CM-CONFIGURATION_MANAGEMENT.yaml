      personnel a configuration management policy that addresses purpose,
      scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
      organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the
      implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is
      maintained in the {{contractor.name_short}} Configuration Management (CM)
      Policy. This document can be found in the {{contractor.name_short}}
      Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <{{contractor.compliance_docs_url}}>.

      Configuration changes are overseen by the Change Control Board (CCB)
      consisting of the System Owner, Project Manager, {{contractor.name_short}}
      Operations staff and the engineering team.

      Security impact analysis is conducted and documented within the Change
      Request (CR) process described in CM-3(b). All proposed configuration-
      controlled changes to the application are tested first in a sandboxed
      development environment before being pushed to a staging environment to
      be tested by another developer and by the Engineering team prior to final
      approval from CCB to move changes to the production environment.
