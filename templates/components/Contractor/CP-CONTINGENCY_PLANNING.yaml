      The Contingency Plan documents the mechanisms with supporting procedures
      that allow all system components to be recovered and reconstituted to
      the systemâ€™s original state after a disruption or failure. This original
      state means that all system parameters (either default or organization-
      established) are reset, patches are reinstalled, system and security
      configuration settings are reestablished, system documentation and
      operating procedures are available, application and system software is
      reinstalled, information from the most recent backups is available and
      the system is fully tested.
