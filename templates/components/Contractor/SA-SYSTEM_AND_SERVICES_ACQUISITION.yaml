      The system and application(s) are managed by {{contractor.name_short}} using the Agile software
      development methodology, which provides a continuous System Development Life
      Cycle (SDLC) methodology. {{contractor.name_short}} Agile management continues to improve
      the software through ongoing planned code releases. The process is overseen
      by the Change Control Board (CCB) as described in CM-1. Each point release introduces
      code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:

      • Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request
      project of the {{contractor.name_short}} ticketing system which describes the overall goals
      of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in the
      ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release.
      Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades
      to newer versions of the software packages that have been used to build the
      website.

      • Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented
      through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks. 
      Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which the CCB selects a
      list of tickets to be implemented. {{contractor.name_short}} Development holds daily coordination
      meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems
      that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a
      retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which
      issues have been resolved and which need further work.

      • Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate
      code branch within the {{contractor.name_short}} git repository, and tested using the Gitlab
      Runner continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to
      prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such
      as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on
      a ticket is completed, the developer creates a merge request, and the changes
      are submitted to at least one other developer for review to ensure they meet
      functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull
      request is merged into the git repository's development branch for the planned
      code release.

      • Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and
      configuration necessary to implement the changes are merged into the website's
      staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no
      conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.

      • User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against
      a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined
      user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and
      to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release
      notes to be shared with the customer.

      • Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all
      of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production
      and presented to {{contractor.name_short}}' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.

      • Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately
      prior to the deployment.

      • Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a
      security scan using a web vulnerability scanner.

      Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from a
      variety of sources:

      • Customer support requests received by the {{contractor.name_short}} Help Desk

      • Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by users

      • Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis
      of those incidents performed by {{contractor.name_short}}' Security Office and Operations
      staff

      • Security notifications received by {{contractor.name_short}}' Security Office from external
      security teams and other software vendors

      • Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by
      {{contractor.name_short}}' Security Office

      • Issues reported by {{contractor.name_short}}' Security Office, Operations staff and Development

      • Security issues reported through continuous monitoring

      The {{contractor.name_short}} organization defines and documents information security roles
      and responsibilities throughout the SDLC. The following teams participate in
      this process:

      • Customer Support: Files tickets when incidents are reported and shares incident
      reports with customers

      • {{contractor.name_short}}' Security Office: Receives security notifications from the Drupal
      security team and other software vendors; performs security scans; uses {{contractor.name_short}}

      are reported; assists in root cause analysis

      • Change Control Board: Meets weekly to review and approve upcoming planned
      code changes to the website, include security-related code releases.

      • AWS Cloud: Monitors server and application events; proactively respond to
      security incidents, and reports incidents to {{contractor.name_short}}

      • Users: Communicates customer security requirements and expectations, and alerts
      {{contractor.name_short}}' customer support team whenever it detects a security or site performance
      issue

      Security responsibilities performed by these teams include the following:

      • Perform configuration management during information system design, development,
      implementation, and operation;

      • Implement only organization-approved changes;

      • Document approved changes;

      • Manage and control changes to the system;

      • Fully test all changes, taking into account security considerations as well
      as other functional requirements;

      • Track security flaws and flaw resolution; and

      • Employ code analysis tools to examine software for common flaws and document
      the results of the analysis.

      Information system security engineering principles are applied in the specification,
      design, development, implementation, and modification of the application system.

      Sound security policy, developing layered protections, and controls have been
      established as the foundation for design throughout the SDLC defined in control
      SA-3. Security requirements are incorporated into that SDLC, as described previously.

      {{contractor.name_short}} uses a development-stage-production testing and management workflow
      as part of the {{contractor.name_short}} development model. Changes are first tested on a
      development environment, then moved to a staging environment for further testing.
      Once the changes have been tested and approved, a backup is made of the production
      environment, and the changes are then deployed. More information regarding this
      model can be found in CM-3 and CM-4. The {{contractor.name_short}} organization ensures that
      all its developers are trained on how to build secure software, that security
      controls have been tailored to meet business and operational needs.
