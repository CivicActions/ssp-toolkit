      identify new threats/vulnerabilities and technologies that may require
      updating of solicitation documents.

      The {{project.name_short}} System Owner is responsible for leading the
      annual budgeting process and for tracking organizational spending. The
      System Owner coordinates with the {{contractor.name_short}} Project
      Manager and {{contractor.name_short}} Security on at least monthly basis
      to track security priorities and spending patterns and determine financial
      requirements. The System Owner also coordinates the approval process for
      interim increases to the security budget, if required. This data is used
      to support the development of the annual budget.


      Security costs are included in Exhibit 53 in the Department's on-line
      electronic Capital Planning and Investment Control system (eCPIC) in order
      to provide adequate business case information for budget purposes.
      Security costs are represented across the life cycle in the business case
      (Exhibit 300) for major investments and (Exhibit 53) for non-major projects
      - {{project.name_short}} is a non-major project. Security costs are
      summarized and listed as a line item on the Exhibit 53 in the budget
      submitted to Treasury.


      Costs for providing security at the infrastructure level are contained in
      the business cases for infrastructure supporting computing platforms,
      desktop processing, the network environment, and web capability. Since
      the Exhibit 53 includes projections for multiple fiscal years, its
      intention is to identify and anticipate security resources required.

      The {{project.name_short}} draws from the {{project.info_security_policy}},
      NIST SP 800-64, and Agile software development methodology to ensure
      security requirements are incorporated during each phase of the life
      cycle. This helps to ensure the development of secure systems and
      effective risk management.

      The {{project.name_short}} follows the guidelines and procedures within
      the overarching {{project.info_security_policy}}. The requirements in
      the information system acquisition contract permit updating security
      controls as new threat/vulnerabilities are identified and new technologies
      are implemented.


      The {{project.name_short}} System and Services Acquisition Policy contains
      the process for determining acceptance criteria for all
      {{project.name_short}} system software and services.


      The {{project.name_short}} organization reviews and approves all
      acquisition contracts in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive
      Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and
      organizational mission/business needs.

      the {{project.name_short}} system for internal {{contractor.name_short}}
      and customer are implemented under access management and enforcement
      (AC-2 and AC-3) and identification and authentication for all users
      (IA-2 and IA-8).


      It is the responsibility of {{contractor.name_short}} for implementation
      of PIV capability for authentication as required.
