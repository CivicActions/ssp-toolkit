      System and communications protection policy and procedures are formally
      documented in the {{project.info_security_policy}} and the
      {{project.name_short}} SSP. The Department reviews and updates the policy
      as necessary and has been continually updated since April 2008.

      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be
      obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

      The {{project.name_short}} system is configured to reduce vulnerabilities
      in its operating system and applications to protect against Denial of
      Service (DoS) attacks.

      The {{project.name_short}} support staff ensures the system is protected
      against or limits the effect of DoS attacks as specified in the
      {{project.info_security_policy}}.

      The {{project.name_short}} system has monitored and controlled
      communications at the external boundary of the information system and at
      key internal boundaries within the system, where appropriate. The
      {{project.name_short}} allocates publicly accessible information system
      components (e.g., public web servers) specific IP address and port
      combinations. Public access into the organization’s internal networks is
      prevented except as appropriately mediated.

      Use of cryptographic key management for the {{project.name_short}} system
      is in use for at the time of implementation for authentication.
      {{contractor.name_short}} utilizes customer agency supplied PIV
      credentials for access to customer instances of the {{project.name_short}}.
      Access enforcement and authentication requirements for
      {{project.name_short}} are described in AC-2 & IA-2. AWS platform does
      not utilize or manage cryptographic keys within the ACE boundary.
