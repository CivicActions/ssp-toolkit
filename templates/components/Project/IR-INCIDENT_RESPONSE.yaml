      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be
      obtained from the Agency common control catalog.


      The {{project.name_short}} maintains an Incident Response Plan (IRP),
      consistent with NIST 800-61, which addresses purpose, scope, roles, and
      responsibilities. The incident response procedures address any activity
      or occurrence that compromises the integrity of a system, denies
      access to or use of IT resources, and compromises the sensitivity of the
      information stored in, processed by or transmitted by a system.


      Additionally, the IRP includes procedures to respond to waste, fraud,
      misuse, or abuse of any departmental IT system, damage or loss of software
      or data contained in any system, Use of unlicensed (pirated) software
      products, discovery of hardware or software vulnerabilities


      The {{project.name_short}} Incident Response Plan can be found in the
      {{contractor.name_short}} GitHub repository at

      {{contractor.name_short}} Operations and users of the
      {{project.name_short}} system with incident response responsibilities are
      required to participate in incident response training once the role is
      assumed within 10 days, as required by {{project.name_short}} changes,
      and annually. The Incident Response Plan
      (<{{project.incident_response_plan_url}}>) is the basis for the training
      and the incident response workflow created by the Security team. Upon a
      review of past incidents, the training is updated to ensure processes and
      workflows are updated.

      The {{project.client_name_short}} Computer Security Officer (CSO) handles
      all incidents for the {{project.name}}.


      The {{project.client_name}} utilizes proven incident handling
      methodologies for security incidents that includes preparation, detection
      and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.
      {{project.client_name}} maintains a list of lessons learned from ongoing
      incident handling activities and uses those lessons to update the incident
      response procedures accordingly.


      Preparation activities includes all {{contractor.name_short}} and
      {{project.name_short}} internal users are trained if their role includes
      incident response. Detection monitoring tools providing notification to
      incident response personnel for analysis and action. Containment,
      eradication and recovery activities include AWS and LAMP-stack inherited
      fixes and {{project.name_short}} system administrators adjusting IP port
      blocking security groups and SELinux policies.

      The {{project.name_short}} Incident Response Plan
      (<{{project.incident_response_plan_url}}>) includes a comprehensive
      incident response program, which details the implementation of procedures
      and tools required for incident handling. The incident response program
      details the roles and responsibilities of {{project.name_short}}/
      {{contractor.name_short}} IR Team. The IR Team includes members from
      {{contractor.name_short}} Security and Operations teams. Incident
      response plays a pivotal role in monitoring, detecting and handling
      security incidents of the entire information system. The IRP details
      categorization of incidents in accordance with NIST 800-61 and accordingly
      documents and reports incidents. The IRP is reviewed annually and updated
      as needed by ISSO, with the assistance of the Incident Response Team.
