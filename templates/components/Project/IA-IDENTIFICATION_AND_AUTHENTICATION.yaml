      The {{project.name_short}} system owners/managers manage user identifiers
      by: (i) uniquely identifying each user; (ii) verifying the identity of
      each user; (iii) receiving authorization to issue a user identifier from
      an appropriate official; (iv) ensuring that the user identifier is issued
      to the intended party; (v) disabling user identifier after a reasonable
      period of inactivity as documented in its security procedures; and (vi)
      archiving user identifiers. {{project.name_short}} reviews and updates
      this policy as necessary.

      Authentication for {{project.name_short}} internal personnel are created
      during the personnel assignment process where requests are made to the
      {{project.name_short}} admin group for proper access levels. The
      {{project.name_short}} admin group verifies the identity of the user. The
      website performs further verification by sending an email to the user's
      mailbox containing a single-use activation link which must be used to log
      in to the account for the first time and to create a password.

      When entering a user account password upon initial login, all users must
      comply with the following password policies, which are enforced by the
      website's software configuration:


      - Password must be at least 14 characters in length.

      - Password must contain at least one digit.

      - Password must contain at least one special character (not whitespace or an alphanumeric).

      - Password must contain at least one uppercase character.

      - Password must contain at least one lowercase character.

      {{project.name_short}} is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning
      end user accounts, which must comply with the strict password policies that
      are enforced by the website's software configuration, as described in
      IA-5(d).


      In accordance with {{project.name_short}} site configuration, the
      following administrative procedures exist for initial authenticator
      distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged authenticators, and for
      revoking authenticators.


      - Initial authenticator distribution: Users receive a one-time login link
        by email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log
        in and then must enter a password themselves which complies with the
        password complexity requirements described in IA-4(b).

      - Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators: Users who have forgotten their
        password may request a new password by submitting their username or
        email address. The website responds by emailing a one-time login link
        to the user's email address. After using the link to log in, the user
        is required to enter a new password.

      - Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in
        the last 90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators may block
        any user account if they believe there is a reason to do so.

      {{project.name_short}} authenticators follow these password lifetime restrictions:


      - Maximum password age = 90

      {{project.name_short}} enforces password lifetime restrictions. The
      password lifetime settings for internal accounts is as follows:


      - Minimum restriction of zero (1) days and

      - Maximum restriction of ninety (90) days before a password change is required.
