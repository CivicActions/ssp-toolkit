      The {{project.name}} will conduct annual security assessments to comply
      with FISMA and NIST regulations. {{project.name_short}} will draw on NIST
      Special Publications 800-53A security controls to complete the assessment.
      All controls and sub-set security controls will be evaluated and a risk
      assessment will be conducted. The scope of the assessment includes:


      1. Security controls and control enhancements under assessment

      2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness

      3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities
