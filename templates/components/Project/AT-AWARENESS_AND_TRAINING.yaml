      Security awareness and training policy and procedures are formally
      documented in {{project.info_security_policy}}, which provides the roles and
      responsibilities as it pertains to security awareness and training. The
      Department will ensure all users, including managers and senior
      executives, are exposed to basic information system security awareness
      materials before authorizing access to the system and at least annually
      thereafter. {{project.client_name_short}} documents and monitors all
      individual information system security training activities including basic security awareness training. {{project.info_security_policy_agency}} reviews
      and updates the policy as necessary.

      {{project.client_name_short}} personnel and contractor employees involved
      with the management, operation, programming, maintenance, or use of
      {{project.name_short}} system receive training in acceptable computer
      security practices prior to system access. All {{project.client_name_short}}
      employees and contractors are required to complete annual IT security
      awareness training. This security awareness training covers issues and
      policies associated with information security, including end user security
      roles and responsibilities and rules of behavior. Some topics addressed in
      the training are:


      - Password protection

      - System rules of behavior

      - Protection of hardware, software, and data

      - Proper handling of copyrighted materials

      - Reporting of security breaches and violations

      - Proper procedures for software installation, uploading, and use on
        workstations.

      Completion of role-based training is an annual requirement for personnel
      in roles with significant information security responsibilities that
      require specialized role-based training. Role-based cybersecurity training
      is developed and implemented to meet identified training needs and
      competencies associated with the various target audiences/functional roles
      (federal and contractor employees) that comprise the
      {{project.client_name_short}} workforce, as is identified in and required
      by the FISMA and OMB A-130, Appendix III. The appropriate content of
      security training is determined based on the assigned roles and
      responsibilities of individuals and the specific security requirements of
      the Department, PO and the information systems to which personnel have
      authorized access. Annual training requirements may be met by completing
      one or more course(s) within the Departmentâ€™s learning management systems,
      participating in instructor-led training provided by the OCIO, or
      completing an external role-based course or courses offered within their
      specific functional area of expertise.
