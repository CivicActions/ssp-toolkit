      The {{project.name_short}} developed its security policy planning and
      procedures based on {{project.info_security_policy}}, guidance from NIST,
      the Office of Management and Budget and industry best practices. Security
      policies and procedures are formally documented within the
      {{project.name_short}} SSP, which provides the roles and responsibilities
      as it pertains to security planning. It provides guidance on all aspects
      of security for the protection of {{project.name_short}} information
      technology resources. It defines responsibilities for the implementation
      and oversight of the guidance contained herein. The plan was last updated

      The System Security Plan (SSP) was developed and implemented for
      {{project.name_short}} system in accordance with
      {{project.info_security_policy}}, NIST SP 800-18 and NIST SP 800-37. The
      SSP includes a description of the management, operational, and technical
      controls in place or planned for the application. The SSP is included as
      a key document in an application’s C&A package and is reviewed and
      approved by designated officials. The SSP identifies the system owner and
      responsible parties for managing system access and the overall security of
      the system. The Chief Information Security Officer reviews and approves
      the SSP. The SSP will be reviewed at least annually and updated to account
      for any changes to the {{project.name_short}} system and to address any
      changes in security controls.
