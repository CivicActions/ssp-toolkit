      The {{project.name_short}} maintains a record of system activity by
      application process and by user activity. Audit and accountability policy
      and procedures are documented within the {{project.name_short}} SSP.
      Security software features are used to automatically generate and store
      security audit log records for use in monitoring security-related events
      on all multi-user systems. The {{project.client_name_short}} reviews and
      updates this policy as necessary and it was last updated in April 2008.
      Additional information is contained within the {{project.info_security_policy}}.
