      AWS built-in features of Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides the capability
      for uniquely identifying and authenticating users and processes acting on their behalf
      to both organizational and non-organizational users operating within the AWS account
      and infrastructure, providing privileges based on the credentials, group memberships,
      and access policies assigned to them. The customer organization, at its discretion,
      provides individual user accounts and privileges to both organizational
      non-organizational users in addition to organizational users.

      AWS built-in features of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides the capability
      for Hardware MFA using Gemalto SafeNet IDProve 100 and 700 OTP Tokens which are compliant
      to OATH open standard (time based - 6 digits) Expected battery life is 3-5 years or
      approximately 15,000 - 20,000 clicks. These products are handheld devices that provide
      strong authentication by generating a unique password that is valid for only one attempt
      and for 30 seconds.


      It is the customer organization's responsibility to implement Hardware MFA.

      In this architecture, All Amazon EC2 instances (bastion host, web/proxy servers, application servers) employ SSH for interactive login, and when a key passphrase is prompted for, the SSH prompting mechanism obscures the feedback by default.


      AWS built-in features obscure keystroke feedback for password input during AWS console
      login with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials, and when the
      CloudFormation console prompts for an initial database password during Quick Start
      template deployment.
