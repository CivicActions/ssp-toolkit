      In this architecture, a baseline set of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups
      and roles are created, with associated access policies, to support alignment of user

      In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail and Amazon S3 Bucket logging are enabled, which
      provides the audit trail capability for the organization to monitor the use of AWS
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts. An Amazon S3 bucket centrally contains
      the CloudTrail audit logs. Amazon CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send an alert when
      an API call is made to create, update or delete a Network ACL/Security Group, when Root
      user activity detected, when multiple API actions or login attempts fail, when IAM
      Configuration changes are detected, when new IAM access key was created and when
      changes to the CloudTrail log configuration is detected

      In this architecture, AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon S3 enforce
      access to the AWS infrastructure and data in S3 buckets. A baseline set of IAM groups
      are created, with associated access policies to support alignment of user accounts to
      personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform management (e.g. Billing, EC2/
      VPC/RDS systems administration, I.T. auditing, etc.) Login/API access is restricted to
      those users for whom the organization has authorized and created or federated IAM user
      accounts, and assigned the appropriate IAM group and/or role membership. Amazon S3
      buckets have specific access control policies assigned to restrict access to those IAM
      users who are assigned the appropriate IAM roles/groups.
