      In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail and Amazon S3 Bucket logging are enabled, which
      provide the audit trail capability for the organization to monitor the use of AWS
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts. An Amazon S3 bucket centrally contains
      the CloudTrail audit logs. Amazon CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send an
      alert when any of the following happen:
        - an API call is made to create, update, or delete a Network ACL/Security Group
        - AWS account *root user* activity is detected
        - multiple API actions or login attempts fail
        - IAM Configuration changes are detected
        - new IAM access key was created
        - changes to the CloudTrail log configuration are detected

      In this architecture, AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon
      Amazon S3 enforce access to the AWS infrastructure and data in Amazon S3 buckets. The
      baseline IAM groups and roles are associated with access policies to
      align user accounts with personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform
      management (e.g. Billing, Amazon EC2/VPC/Amazon RDS systems administration, I.T.
      auditing, etc.) Login/API access is restricted to those users for whom the
      organization has authorized and created, or federated, IAM user accounts,
      and assigned the appropriate IAM group and/or role memberships. Amazon S3
      buckets have specific access control policies assigned to restrict access
      to those IAM users who are assigned the appropriate IAM roles/groups.
