      In this architecture, user data is limited to that which is stored in the Amazon RDS
      database. Amazon RDS is fully backed up by a daily snapshot as well as through transaction
      logging conducted by AWS as part of this managed service. Full database recovery from
      snapshot or point-in-time can be initiated from the Amazon RDS console/API.

      AWS built-in features automatically backs up system-level information limited to
      infrastructure CONFIGURATION information within the AWS account. While individual
      running Amazon EC2 instances and attached EBS volumes are NOT backed up, they can be
      reconstituted from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) provided by AWS (which are backed up
      by AWS) and user data scripts included in CloudFormation templates. Once deployed, the
      CloudFormation template contents are backed up by AWS R488within the CloudFormation
      service. These AWS backups of AWS services are transparent to the customer as part of
      AWS backend processes.

      AWS built-in features protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
      information that AWS services back up. This information includes the service
      configuration information within an account, AWS online administrator and developer
      documentation, and AWS CloudFormation stacks for templates once deployed into an
      account. R612
