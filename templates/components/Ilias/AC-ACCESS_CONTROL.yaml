      Access control in Ilias is enforced by authentication via Shibboleth single
      sing on (SSO) for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges,
      permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.

      The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
      does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. {{project.name_short}}
      Administrators, HR Managers, and Org Managers are the only roles that
      can create new user accounts.
