      Ilias provides user accounts for individuals who participate in visiting, contributing
      to and administering the site with the following roles:

      • Anonymous user – Readers of the site who either do not have an account or
      are not logged in.

      • Guest – This role has limited visibility and read permissions

      • User - Standard role for registered users. This role grants read access to
      most objects.

      • Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.

      Access control in Ilias is enforced by authentication via Shibboleth single
      sing on (SSO) for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges,
      permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.

      The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
      does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. {{project.name_short}}
      Administrators, HR Managers, and Org Managers are the only roles that
      can create new user accounts.

      {{contractor.name_short}} implements the policy of least privilege for all logical components
      of Ilias by allowing only authorized access for users, which are necessary to
      accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational
      needs.

      At the application layer, Ilias is designed with a role-based user access system,
      a least-privileged approach based on the assignment of privileges to roles.
      Ilias‘s permission systems enable control of what users can do and see on the
      site. {{contractor.name_short}} has defined a specific set of permissions for each of
      the user roles mentioned in control AC-5.

      SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing
      basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are
      reported and reviewed by the {{contractor.name_short}} Data team and evaluated to determine
      roles that need to be revoked.
