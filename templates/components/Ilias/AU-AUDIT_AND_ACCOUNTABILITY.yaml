      Transaction logs are generated by the Apache web server, Ilias CMS, MySQL database
      and PHP page processing. Specifically, the following server, application, database
      and network device audit log events are captured:

      - Apache access log: Contains a list of requests for your website that have
      bypassed Varnish. These requests include pages, theme files, and static media
      files.

      - Apache error log: Records any Apache-level issues. The issues reported here
      are usually caused by general server issues, including capacity problems, .htaccess
      problems, and missing files.

      - Ilias page request log: Records all Ilias page loads on your website.

      - Ilias log: Records Ilias-related actions on your website. The log is recorded
      on your server.

      - MySQL slow query log: Contains a list of MySQL queries that have taken longer
      than one second to complete.

      - PHP error log: Records any issues that occur during the PHP processing portion
      of a page load. Issues reported here are usually caused by a websiteâ€™s code,
      configuration, or content.

      {{contractor.name_short}} has extensive experience and specialization as a host
      of websites that are built using the Ilias web learning platform. Should the
      need for additional logging become evident, we have the ability to do so by
      modifying the website's source code to insert additional Ilias logging hooks.

      The logs collected for Ilias sites include the following types of information:

      - IP number of the request originator

      - Timestamp

      - Username

      - Ilias log message (if applicable)

      - Unique numerical ID of the content being modified (for content creation, modification
      and deletion events)

      When auditing an Ilias incident, {{contractor.name_short}}' developers aggregate log
      sources from multiple servers into the Graylog dashboard so that all log entries
      for a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document.
      Log sources are sorted, filtered and reviewed. Application logs are maintained
      primarily for an after-the-fact investigation of critical systems or security
      events.
