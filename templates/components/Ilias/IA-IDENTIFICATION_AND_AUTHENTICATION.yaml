  narrative:
  - key: a
    text: Upon account creation, the Ilias software assigns each user account a unique
      numerical user ID (UID). This UID is used internally by the system to track
      user actions such as content creation or editing. The numerical user IDs are
      never reused even if their user accounts are subsequently blocked or deleted.
  - key: b
    text: When Ilias user accounts are created, users' email addresses are verified
      by sending a single-use activation link to the user’s mailbox. The email recipient
      then uses the activation link to log in to the website and supply a password
      which must meet the system's password complexity requirements.
  - key: c
    text: Identifiers for {{contractor.name_short}} internal personnel include a username based
      on the individual's full first and last name and are reviewed for uniqueness
      by the admin group when it approves the creation of the user account.
  - key: d
    text: Ilias user's unique identifier (the numeric user ID, or UID) is never reused.

      Refer to control AC-2 in this SSP for further details on account provisioning.

      {{contractor.name_short}} will create and maintain an initial Ilias Administrator (highest
      level of Ilias Account). New Administrators are able to provide additional
      Administrator access at their own discretion and are ultimately responsible
      for managing their own Administrator and other user accounts that they create.
  - key: b
    text: Initial authenticator content (a unique email address – not previously used
      in any other account) is provided by the user. Internal initial password requirements
      set by {{contractor.name_short}} Operations and ongoing password refreshes by internal
      users follow the requirements set in the Identification and Authentication Policy.

      The system partially inherits this control from Ilias standard password management.
      All password creation/change/reset operations are recorded in the website's Ilias logs.
  - key: e
    text: Ilias requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the
      application website enforces this. Each user account is assigned a default
      password that is randomly generated, not possible to guess, and not shared
      with anyone, including site administrators. When the user logs in and
      creates a new password, the default password is erased from the website
      database.
  - key: h
    text: For all Ilias users, passwords are protected by the website's software,
      which only stores an encrypted string based on the password. This means that
      even if the website's database should be compromised, an attacker would still
      be unable to know users' actual passwords. Internal users receive training in
      security awareness and acceptable use and are instructed never to reveal their
      passwords to anyone.
  - key: i
    text: >
      Ilias users are required to take appropriate measures in the handling of passwords
      including:

      - Not transmitting user names and passwords together in an unencrypted format

      - Not permitting the sending of passwords in an unencrypted format via email

      - Not listing passwords in tickets

      - Not writing down or storing passwords in a readable form in any physical or
      logical location where they may be discoverable by unauthorized persons.
  - key: j
    text: This control is not applicable due to the fact that group accounts are not
      created within the Ilias application per IA Policy.

      Ilias supports the requirement for password-based authentication complexity.
      New users of Ilias are required to specify their password authentication as
      soon as they log in to the website for the first. The website requires all
      submitted passwords to comply with validation rules, as described above in IA-5(c).

      Changing password lifetime, length, reuse or strength requirements requires
      a code setting change that therefore needs to be planned and approved by {{
      contractor}}' Change Control Board before being implemented.
  - key: b
    text: When required to change passwords, Ilias users are required to change their
      authenticator password by changing at least one character. Enforcement of this
      control is implemented through the website's software configuration.
  - key: c
    text: All Ilias passwords are encrypted in storage, using the SHA-512 hashing
      algorithm with a salt. The hash function is performed repeatedly to further
      obfuscate the password via key stretching. In transmission, passwords are encrypted
      using SSL via HTTPS.
  - key: d
    text: The website requires all submitted passwords to comply with lifetime rules,
      as described above in IA-5(g).
  - key: e
    text: Password reuse is limited through software configuration.
  - key: f
    text: When website users request a password reset, the website sends a temporary
      login link to the email address associated with their user account. After a
      user logs in via the temporary login link, the website requires the user to
      enter a new password before proceeding further.
