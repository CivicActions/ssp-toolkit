# Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

**Unique Project Identifier (UPI):** None

## Project description

None

_This PIA is for the IT system listed in the table below._

| Name of System | Social Security Numbers? | Other Personally Identifiable Information (PII)? | Business Identifiable Information? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Project | No | Yes | No |

**OMB Control Numbers:** Most of the information in these systems does not
involve the collection of information from the public; therefore, approval from the Office of Management and Budget is not required, except for the following:


### How will the information be secured?

The _Secure Sockets Layer_ (_SSL_) is the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor to SSL. The TLS protocol provides privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications, enabling private and reliable communications between authenticated identities.

The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) defined an information-security framework to improve computer and network security within the federal government. The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), a non-regulatory agency of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce has developed a set of standards and guidelines (800-series publications) further define this framework.

The _Risk Management Framework_ (_RMF_) - outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 - defines a system lifecycle approach for information systems and organizations. A catalog of security and privacy controls - defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 - outlines the management, operational and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information.

The Project implements the controls defined for low impact systems in the Risk Management Framework, including the use of SSL/TLS for securing data in motion.
