## 1. INTRODUCTION
### 1.1 Scope

This document applies to privileged users of the Example Project system that can
make changes to the production content or user accounts and are not covered by an existing
Rules of Behavior policy, be they federal employees or contracted employees.

### 1.2 Overview

Users must prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of sensitive information,
including Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

The rules delineate responsibilities and expectations for all individuals supporting the
Example Project system with regard to information and usage.
    
### 1.3 Information Sensitivity

Information is considered sensitive if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
availability could be expected to have a serious, severe or catastrophic adverse effect on
organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.  PII is a subset of
sensitive information and is defined as data which can potentially be used to identify,
locate, or contact an individual, or potentially reveal the activities, characteristics,
or other details about a person.

## 2 REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
### 2.1 Example Project Privileged User Rules of Behavior

All privileged Example Project users must acknowledge the following rules of behavior:

* Use Example Project computing resources only for approved
  Example Project-related programs;
* Protect sensitive information from access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized personnel;
* Create and use strong passwords (password managers are recommended):
   * Do not disclose your password to anyone;
   * Do not reuse passwords;
   * Each password should be unique from any other password you use;
* Report any compromise or suspected compromise of a password to designated computer
  security personnel;
* Access only systems, networks, data, and software for which you have been authorized.
  When access is no longer required, contact the appropriate Example Project
  project manager or security personnel as soon as possible;
* Take necessary steps to avoid the introduction of malicious code into any computing
  resource.

### 2.2 Rules of Behavior Non-compliance

Generally, non-compliance of the above rules will, at a minimum, be brought to the
attention of the violator’s immediate supervisor for counseling and correction.  However,
the ultimate consequences of inconsistent behavior or non-compliance will vary on a
case-by-case basis and depend on a number of factors.  The factors include provisions of
federal law and regulations, management judgment, the sensitivity of the position that the
non-compliant person holds, the motivation behind non-compliance, the impact of the
incident, union rules, and federal employment and personnel policy.
