## Introduction

### Purpose

The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) Information Assurance Services (IAS) publication Information  Technology (IT) System Access Controls Standard of February 11, 2022 provides a comprehensive basis for  management across all systems in the Department. This document provides specific guidance as defined and implemented  by the Project.

### Scope

This system has been categorized as a FIPS-199 LOW system, and as such this document applies only to relevant  controls, policies, processes and procedures as defined within the system.

## Standards

### AU-01 Audit And Accountability Policy And Procedures

The Project maintains a record of system activity by application process and by user activity. Audit and accountability policy and procedures are documented within the Project SSP. Security software features are used to automatically generate and store security audit log records for use in monitoring security-related events on all multi-user systems. The Client reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it was last updated in April 2008. Additional information is contained within the None.


CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Audit and Accountability (AU) Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.


### AU-02 Auditable Events

**a.**	Transaction logs are generated by the Apache web server, Ilias CMS, MySQL database and PHP page processing. Specifically, the following server, application, database and network device audit log events are captured:
- Apache access log: Contains a list of requests for your website that have bypassed Varnish. These requests include pages, theme files, and static media files.
- Apache error log: Records any Apache-level issues. The issues reported here are usually caused by general server issues, including capacity problems, .htaccess problems, and missing files.
- Ilias page request log: Records all Ilias page loads on your website.
- Ilias log: Records Ilias-related actions on your website. The log is recorded on your server.
- MySQL slow query log: Contains a list of MySQL queries that have taken longer than one second to complete.
- PHP error log: Records any issues that occur during the PHP processing portion of a page load. Issues reported here are usually caused by a website’s code, configuration, or content.


Drupal's Watchdog log are configured to track all relevant auditable events as defined by Client

- Apache access log: Contains a list of requests for your website that have bypassed Varnish. These requests include pages, theme files, and static media files.
- Apache error log: Records any Apache-level issues. The issues reported here are usually caused by general server issues, including capacity problems, .htaccess problems, and missing files.
- Drupal page request log: Records all Drupal page loads on your website.
- Drupal Watchdog log: Records Drupal-related actions on your website. The Watchdog log is recorded on your database if you have enabled the syslog module.
- MySQL slow query log: Contains a list of MySQL queries that have taken longer than one second to complete.
- PHP error log: Records any issues that occur during the PHP processing portion of a page load. Issues reported here are usually caused by a website’s code, configuration, or content.


In this architecture, the following audit methods log all security-relevant user/API activities and Amazon S3 data access activities, and support the capability to audit organizationally defined events:

- AWS CloudTrail logging
- Amazon S3 bucket logging
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging
- Amazon RDS MySQL error logging


CivicActions' Security Policy provides information about auditing and logging of CivicActions internal users and end-user activity on the servers and within the system application.

**b.**	All security-related issues and events, including requests for server log analysis, are recorded in CivicActions' JIRA tracking system.

Auditable events may change due to changes in the threat environment. CivicActions teams collaborate internally and also communicate with customers and partner organizations to identify and select auditable events. The teams that participate in this process are described in control SA-3(b).

**c.**	CivicActions has extensive experience and specialization as a host of websites that are built using the Ilias web learning platform. Should the need for additional logging become evident, we have the ability to do so by modifying the website's source code to insert additional Ilias logging hooks.


In this architecture, the following audit methods provide data on activities occurring within the infrastructure:

- AWS CloudTrail logging
- Amazon S3 bucket logging
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging
- Amazon RDS MySQL error logging

**d.**	Information captured in the transaction logs includes, but is not limited to, the following auditable events:
- Failed login attempts
- Successful login attempts
- New user account creation
- Password reset instructions mailed
- User logins via a one-time login link
- Content creation
- Content publishing
- Web page not found
- Website configuration changes
- System administration activities
- Slow query logs.
- PHP error logs: Captures any errors logged during execution of the PHP programming
  language.


Information captured in the transaction logs includes, but is not limited to, the following auditable events:

- Failed login attempts
- Successful login attempts
- User account deletions
- User account blocking/unblocking
- Changes in user role assignments
- Unauthorized attempts to alter protected user fields
- New user account creation
- Password reset instructions mailed
- User logins via a one-time login link
- User logouts
- Content creation (datasets, resources and other content types)
- Content modification
- Content deletion
- Content publishing
- Content unpublishing
- File uploads
- Web page not found
- Website configuration changes
- System administration activities
- Slow query logs.
- PHP error logs: Captures any errors logged during execution of the PHP programming language.


In this architecture, the following audit methods log all security-relevant events and errors related to IAM user and API activities, Amazon S3 data access, network access, and Amazon RDS database errors, and support the capability to audit organizationally defined events:

- AWS CloudTrail logging
- Amazon S3 bucket logging
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging
- Amazon RDS MySQL error logging

### AU-03 Content Of Audit Records

The logs collected for Ilias sites include the following types of information:
- IP number of the request originator
- Timestamp
- Username
- Ilias log message (if applicable)
- Unique numerical ID of the content being modified (for content creation, modification and deletion events)
When auditing an Ilias incident, CivicActions' developers aggregate log sources from multiple servers into the Graylog dashboard so that all log entries for a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document. Log sources are sorted, filtered and reviewed. Application logs are maintained primarily for an after-the-fact investigation of critical systems or security events.


The logs collected for Drupal sites include the following types of information:

- IP number of the request originator
- Timestamp
- Request URL
- HTTP status code returned
- Username
- Drupal Watchdog message (if applicable)
- Unique numerical ID of the content being modified (for content creation, modification and deletion events)
When auditing a Drupal incident, the CivicActions developers aggregate log sources from multiple servers into the Graylog dashboard so that all log entries for a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document. Log sources are sorted, filtered and reviewed. Application logs are maintained primarily for an after-the-fact investigation of critical systems or security events.


In this architecture, the following audit methods generate records with the level of detail specified for the control:

- **AWS CloudTrail logging**: Provides information on activities
  related to infrastructure changes.

- **Amazon S3 bucket logging**: Provides data on activities related to the
  access or manipulation of data stored in Amazon S3.

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging**: Provides information about
  requests or connections.

- **Amazon RDS MySQL error logging**: Captures errors encountered by the
  database engine. In addition, the MySQL general query log can be enabled
  by the customer organization to capture when clients connect or disconnect
  and SQL statements received from clients.

- AWS native logging: https://aws.amazon.com/answers/logging/aws-native-security-logging-capabilities/
- AWS CloudTrail logs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference.html
- Amazon S3 bucket logs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazons3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html
- ELB logs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html
    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html

- Amazon RDS logs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonrds/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html


### AU-04 Audit Storage Capacity

In this architecture, logs track dynamic capacity growth to accommodate organizationally defined storage capacity requirements. Amazon S3 buckets are established to store audit logs from the following audit methods:

- AWS CloudTrail logging
- Amazon S3 bucket logging
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging
- Amazon RDS MySQL error logging


CivicActions ensures adequate storage capability requirements listed in AU-11 for all events from the application, database, and hosting environment.


### AU-05 Response To Audit Processing Failures

When notified (e.g., via CloudWatch) of an auditing failure, CivicActions Operations staff will review the causes and take corrective action.


**a.**	In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail is enabled, and provides the basis for audit processing within the infrastructure.

AWS built-in features include customer alerting of AWS CloudTrail and other service failures through the following:

- AWS Service Health Dashboard (http://status.aws.amazon.com)
- RSS feeds to which the customer organization can subscribe
- email
- alerts sent directly to the AWS account *root user* for critical events
- AWS internal Incident Response and corporate communications processes

### AU-06 Audit Review, Analysis, And Reporting

**a.**	CivicActions security audit data is collected by the AWS CloudWatch monitoring and observability service to support real time and after-the-fact investigation at the application level for the following:

- Indications of inappropriate or unusual activity
- Assurance that logging is functioning properly
- Adherence to logging standards identified in this procedure

**b.**	Any significant findings observed during the inspection are reported to CivicActions' Security Office. If these are considered to constitute a security incident, then the Incident Response process is invoked as described in the implementation of the Incident Response Plan (IR-8).

### AU-08 Time Stamps

The Project system clocks are synchronized system-wide and provide time stamps with audit records.


**a.**	AWS includes the Amazon Time Sync Service. Running over Network Time Protocol (NTP), this service synchronizes the time on AWS instances using redundant satellite-connected and atomic clocks in all public AWS regions. The Amazon Time Sync Service provides accurate time stamp data to the following audit methods:

- AWS CloudTrail logging
- Amazon S3 bucket logging
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging
- Amazon RDS MySQL error logging

**b.**	The Amazon Time Sync Service provides accurate time stamp data to the following audit methods:

- AWS CloudTrail logging
- Amazon S3 bucket logging
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging
- Amazon RDS MySQL error logging

Time stamps are recorded as specified in the ISO 8601 standard. ISO 8601 represents local time (with the location unspecified), as UTC, or as an offset from UTC.

### AU-09 Protection Of Audit Information

Access to audit data and tools is determined by access control policies for IAM groups and roles. Only users assigned to IAM groups and roles with access to audit data and tools can access them. Additionally, AWS uses server-side encryption on Amazon S3 bucket logs, and maintains them as read-only files.


CivicActions ensures that audit logs are created, stored and maintained. Developers who have been assigned as members of the CivicActions Security Office are the only CivicActions personnel with logical permission to access and review audit logs.


### AU-11 Audit Record Retention

AWS CloudTrail logs are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, which dynamically allocates storage capacity to support continuous collection and storage of AWS CloudTrail log data. The storage capacity supports indefinite retention, but with 7 year retention specified, and migration to Amazon Glacier after 90 days in AWS regions where Glacier is available.


CivicActions audits events from the application, database, and hosting environment, and retains these records for at least 180 days.


### AU-12 Audit Generation

**a.**	In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3 bucket logging, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging, and Amazon RDS MySQL error logging are  enabled, but initial Amazon EC2 instances launched by this deployment (bastion host, application servers, proxy servers, and any Amazon EC2-based NAT servers) do not have auditing enabled within the OS, as these are for example purposes only.

AWS built-in features of logging mechanisms provide the audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2a. by logging all security-relevant IAM user and API activities which address AWS infrastructure components (AWS Products and services), ELB


CivicActions ensures audit records are generated for its web and event logs as required in AU-2 and AU-3 for servers, application, database, and network components.

**b.**	In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3 bucket logging, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging, and Amazon RDS MySQL error logging are enabled AWS CloudTrail is enabled to log all available API events automatically within the AWS infrastructure and Amazon S3 bucket logging is enabled to log bucket activity.

AWS built-in features of Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows policy to be applied to privileged users for administrator/audit access, allowing them to modify Amazon CloudWatch alarms, AWS Config rules, and Amazon S3 bucket logging to select the CloudTrail and Amazon S3 events that are to cause notification, alerting and automated reaction.


The selected auditable events described in AU-2 are coordinated by CivicActions internal admins and client security/operations officers for each component of the production system.

**c.**	In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3 bucket logging, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging, and Amazon RDS MySQL error logging are enabled. However, the initial Amazon EC2 instances launched by this deployment (bastion host, application servers, proxy servers, and any Amazon EC2-based NAT servers) DO NOT have any auditing enabled within the OS, as these are in place for example purposes only.

AWS built-in features of native logging generates audit records with the content defined in AU-3.
