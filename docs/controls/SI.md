**Status:** Complete

##### CivicActions

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a system and information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions System and Information Integrity (SI) Policy document that can be found in the CivicActions GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.


##### Project

System and information integrity policy and procedures for the Project system are formally documented in the Project SSP, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to physical and environmental protection systems. The Project system support staff monitors the network on a daily basis and employs up-to-date patches to protect the integrity of the system.

Additional information is contained within the None.

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.


### SI-2: Flaw Remediation

```text
The organization:
  a.  Identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws;
  b.  Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness
and potential side effects before installation;
  c.  Installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment:
organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates; and
  d.  Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management
process.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### Ilias

Ilias contains built-in security status monitoring of the core application and contributed modules.

#### a

##### CivicActions

Identification of information system security flaws are detected as early as possible by the following methods:

- Vulnerability scans, as described in RA-5.
- Log analysis from monitoring described in SI-4.
- Service flaw notifications (CVEs, etc.) are received by the
  CivicActions Security Office and passed on to
  CivicActions Operations staff when relevant.

Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA and/or the Git issue queue. CivicActions Operations staff prioritizes high findings. Changes made to correct the information system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled and coordinated through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals required from the CCB as implemented in CM-3.


#### b

##### CivicActions

CivicActions testing of the system as a result of security flaw remediation is done through a development environment through the use of internal software and automated testing that ensures the system is working as intended. When a change is made by a developer, testing though a peer review is conducted as part of the Change Request process to ensure the correct analysis is completed. Then the changed code is tested in an automatic test environment as described in the Configuration Management Plan (CMP). Tracking of the testing is documented in JIRA and/or the Git issue queue.


#### c

##### CivicActions

CivicActions security-software updates are tested prior to implementation on production. The CivicActions Security framework for installation requires updates to be made within 30 days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities, and 240 for low vulnerabilities. An issue ticket is created to track any updates made to the system.


#### d

##### CivicActions

Flaw remediation is part of the CivicActions configuration management process. Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA or the Git issue queue. The CivicActions Security Office prioritizes the high findings within the application. Changes made to correct the system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled and coordinated through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals required from the CCB Chair as implemented in CM-3.


### SI-3: Malicious Code Protection

```text
The organization:
  a.  Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry
and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code;
  b.  Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available
in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;
  c.  Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:
    1.  Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection (one or more); endpoint; network entry/exit points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and
    2.  [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code;  send
alert to administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code detection; and
  d.  Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection
and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.
```

**Status:** Complete

#### a

##### CivicActions

Virus scans are performed by ClamAV, a server-hosted tool protecting the application from Trojans, Viruses and other malicious cyber-threats. Real-time scans are conducted whenever files are uploaded from any external source and malicious code is blocked or quarantined when detected. All file-based traffic traversing the server is sanitized before being delivered. All input form text is validated and sanitized.


#### b

##### CivicActions

Anti-virus definitions and malicious code protection mechanisms are configured and updated automatically on a nightly basis.


#### c

##### CivicActions

CivicActions Operations staff receives information system security alerts, advisories, and notifications in response to malicious code detection. These messages are sent to group email distribution lists to ensure all members of the team receive the proper information in a timely manner.


#### d

##### CivicActions

False positives during malicious code detection and eradication are dealt with on a case by case basis. Potential impacts on the availability of the information system are detailed in a false positive report depending on if the report is for the OS, database or web application.


### SI-4: Information System Monitoring

```text
The organization:
  a.  Monitors the information system to detect:
    1.  Attacks and indicators of potential attacks in accordance with [Assignment:
organization-defined monitoring objectives]; and
    2.  Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections;
  b.  Identifies unauthorized use of the information system through [Assignment:
organization-defined techniques and methods];
  c.  Deploys monitoring devices:
    1.  Strategically within the information system to collect organization-determined
essential information; and
    2.  At ad hoc locations within the system to track specific types of transactions
of interest to the organization;
  d.  Protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized
access, modification, and deletion;
  e.  Heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there
is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information;
  f.  Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities
in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations; and
  g.  Provides [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring
information] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more): as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].
