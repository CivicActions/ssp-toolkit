This information is maintained by the CivicActions System and Services Acquisition (SA) Policy document that can be found in the CivicActions GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.


##### Project

The Project complies with the None. The Project will identify new threats/vulnerabilities and technologies that may require updating of solicitation documents.

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.


### SA-2: Allocation Of Resources

```text
The organization:
  a.  Determines information security requirements for the information system
or information system service in mission/business process planning;
  b.  Determines, documents, and allocates the resources required to protect the
information system or information system service as part of its capital planning and investment control process; and
  c.  Establishes a discrete line item for information security in organizational
programming and budgeting documentation.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### Project

The Project System Owner is responsible for leading the annual budgeting process and for tracking organizational spending. The System Owner coordinates with the CivicActions Project Manager and CivicActions Security on at least monthly basis to track security priorities and spending patterns and determine financial requirements. The System Owner also coordinates the approval process for interim increases to the security budget, if required. This data is used to support the development of the annual budget.

Security costs are included in Exhibit 53 in the Department's on-line electronic Capital Planning and Investment Control system (eCPIC) in order to provide adequate business case information for budget purposes. Security costs are represented across the life cycle in the business case (Exhibit 300) for major investments and (Exhibit 53) for non-major projects - Project is a non-major project. Security costs are summarized and listed as a line item on the Exhibit 53 in the budget submitted to Treasury.

Costs for providing security at the infrastructure level are contained in the business cases for infrastructure supporting computing platforms, desktop processing, the network environment, and web capability. Since the Exhibit 53 includes projections for multiple fiscal years, its intention is to identify and anticipate security resources required.

**Status:** Complete

##### Project

The Project draws from the None, NIST SP 800-64, and Agile software development methodology to ensure security requirements are incorporated during each phase of the life cycle. This helps to ensure the development of secure systems and effective risk management.


#### a

##### CivicActions

The system and application(s) are managed by CivicActions using the Agile software development methodology, which provides a continuous System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology. CivicActions Agile management continues to improve the software through ongoing planned code releases. The process is overseen by the Change Control Board (CCB) as described in CM-1. Each point release introduces code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:

- Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request project of the CivicActions ticketing system which describes the overall goals of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in the ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release. Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades to newer versions of the software packages that have been used to build the website.
- Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks. Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which the CCB selects a list of tickets to be implemented. CivicActions Development holds daily coordination meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which issues have been resolved and which need further work.
- Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate code branch within the CivicActions Git repository, and tested using the GitLab Runner continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on a ticket is completed, the developer creates a merge request, and the changes are submitted to at least one other developer for review to ensure they meet functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull request is merged into the Git repository's development branch for the planned code release.
- Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and configuration necessary to implement the changes are merged into the website's staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.
- User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release notes to be shared with the customer.
- Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production and presented to CivicActions' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.
- Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately prior to the deployment.
- Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a security scan using a web vulnerability scanner.

  Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from a variety of sources:

- Customer support requests received by the CivicActions Help Desk
- Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by users
- Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis of those incidents performed by the CivicActions Security Office and Operations staff
- Security notifications received by the CivicActions Security Office from external security teams and other software vendors
- Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by the CivicActions Security Office
- Issues reported by the CivicActions Security Office, Operations staff and Development
- Security issues reported through continuous monitoring


#### b

##### CivicActions

The CivicActions organization defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the SDLC. The following teams participate in this process:

- Customer Support: Files tickets when incidents are reported and shares incident reports with customers
- The CivicActions Security Office: Receives security notifications from the Drupal security team and other software vendors; performs security scans; uses CivicActions JIRA ticketing system to request mitigation of all reported vulnerabilities
- CivicActions Development: Performs server log analysis when security incidents are reported; assists in root cause analysis
- Change Control Board: Meets weekly to review and approve upcoming planned code changes to the website, include security-related code releases.
- AWS Cloud: Monitors server and application events; proactively respond to security incidents, and reports incidents to CivicActions
- Users: Communicates customer security requirements and expectations, and alerts the CivicActions customer support team whenever it detects a security or site performance issue

Security responsibilities performed by these teams include the following:

- Perform configuration management during information system design, development, implementation, and operation;
- Implement only organization-approved changes;
- Document approved changes;
- Manage and control changes to the system;
- Fully test all changes, taking into account security considerations as well as other functional requirements;

such trustworthiness.
```

##### AWS

In this architecture, encryption mechanisms are employed for data at rest and in transit. For data at rest, AES-256 Server Side encryption is employed for data stored in Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS databases. For data in transit, to protect against exposure of any cleartext data transmitted deliberately (upload/download) or incidentally during interactive systems management operations, Amazon S3 object access can only be conducted over encrypted sessions via TLS; the bastion host, Amazon EC2 instances and associated security groups are configured for encrypted SSH sessions only. For web user access, the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) employs a TLS endpoint.

AWS built-in features employ TLS for AWS Management Console sessions, AWS API calls, and AWS Command Line Interface connections.
