##### CivicActions

CivicActions will develop a security assessment plan (SAP) that describes the security controls and control enhancements under assessment, assessment procedures used to determine effectiveness, the assessment environment, the assessment team, and the assessment roles and responsibilities.


##### Project

The The Project follows the None. The The Project will conduct annual security assessments to comply with FISMA and NIST regulations. Project will draw on NIST Special Publications 800-53A security controls to complete the assessment. All controls and sub-set security controls will be evaluated and a risk assessment will be conducted. The scope of the assessment includes:

1. Security controls and control enhancements under assessment
2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness
3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities


#### b

##### CivicActions

CivicActions will assess the security controls in their system and its environment of operation to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security requirements.

All controls assigned and documented in this System Security Plan (SSP) will be tested at least annually or when there is a major change to the system.


#### c

##### CivicActions

CivicActions will produce a security assessment report that documents the results of the assessment. The Security Assessment Report must contain the results of the assessment, and may also contain recommendations and suggestions for plans of actions and milestones (POA&Ms).


##### Project

The Project Authorizing Official or Designated Representative will create a Security Assessment Report (SAR). A full assessment shall be conducted by an independent third party assessor at least every three years.


#### d

##### CivicActions

CivicActions will provide the results of the security control assessment to the System Owner, Project Manager, CivicActions Security, and the Authorization Official (AO)). The security control assessment package includes the following:

- Security Control Matrix
- Privacy Impact Assessment
- E-Authentication
- Contingency Plan
- Configuration Management Plan
- Rules of Behavior
- Incident Response Plan


### CA-3: System Interconnections

```text
The organization:
  a.  Authorizes connections from the information system to other information
systems through the use of Interconnection Security Agreements;
  b.  Documents, for each interconnection, the interface characteristics, security
requirements, and the nature of the information communicated; and
  c.  Reviews and updates Interconnection Security Agreements [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency].
```

**Status:** Complete

##### CivicActions

This control is not applicable. CivicActions systems do not have system interconnections. The only communication conducted to CivicActions' systems is through the Internet.


### CA-5: Plan Of Action And Milestones

```text
The organization:
  a.  Develops a plan of action and milestones for the information system to document
the organizationï¿½s planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and
  b.  Updates existing plan of action and milestones [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] based on the findings from security controls assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### CivicActions

CivicActions documents all deficiencies and vulnerabilities identified during the security certification and/or continuous monitoring phase (via security assessment, vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, etc.) within the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).

The POA&M document provides a platform for CivicActions to monitor and track the deficiency and its mitigation strategy. POA&M items will include:

- The description of the deficiency,
- Dedicated point of contact for this deficiency.
- Cost of the mitigation strategy
- Associated risk and NIST control
- Recommended mitigation strategy

POA&Ms are tracked throughout the lifecycle of the system until its mitigation. All POA&Ms are reviewed on a monthly basis by CivicActions Information System Security Officer to ensure all mitigation strategies are continuing as documented.


##### Project

The Project follows the None procedures in managing POA&Ms.


### CA-6: Security Authorization

```

**Status:** Complete

##### Project

The Project follows the None. The Project system received its first three-year security accreditation on March 3, 2009, and most recently received an ATO on February 5, 2016.

ATO re-assessment will be performed every three years or when there is a major change to the application, in which a senior organizational official will sign and approve the security accreditation.


### CA-7: Continuous Monitoring

```text
The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes:
