#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a certification, accreditation, and security assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Security Assessment and Authorization Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The Department of Education developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a certification, accreditation, and security assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management committment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance, and developed, documented and disseminated to personnel procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.The policy is stated in the Office of the Secretary Information Security Policy dated July 17, 2013 and the procedures are defined in the Office of the Secretary Procedures Handbook for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents will be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to the LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating the Security Assessment and Authorization Policy and Procedures annually. The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for approving Security Assessment and Authorization.  All procedures are consistent with requirements of FISMA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, applicable executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. These policies and procedures are applicable to the CivicActions staff administering the lincs.ed.gov information system.

> Security control type: Hybrid


### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions will create internally or work with an independent Third Party Auditor to develop a security assessment plan (SAP) when required by FISMA and NIST. Risks identified during the security assessment are tracked in CivicActions' ticket tracking or software control repository system.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

This will be completed in CY2018.

An independent Third Party Auditor will develop a security assessment plan (SAP) for the LINCS system in support of FISMA and NIST requirements selected by LINCS. Risks identified during the security assessment are tracked in the lincs.ed.gov Github repository. The scope of the assessment includes:

1. Security controls and control enhancements under assessment

2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness

3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All controls assigned and documented in this System Security Plan (SSP) will be tested at least annually or when there is a major change to the system.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

All controls as assigned by LINCS and documented in this System Security Plan (SSP) will be tested at least annually or when there is a major change to the LINCS system, or as directed by LINCS.



### Part c)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

An independent Third Party Auditor of the LINCS System will create a Security Assessment Report (SAR) that will be provided to the internal authorizing official and the LINCS authorizing official.
