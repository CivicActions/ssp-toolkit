## DM: Data Minimization and Retention

### DM-1: MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

```text
"The organization:
     a.    Identifies the minimum personally identifiable information (PII) elements
that are relevant
           and necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection;
     b.    Limits the collection and retention of PII to the minimum elements
identified for the purposes
           described in the notice and for which the individual has provided consent;
and
     c.    Conducts an initial evaluation of PII holdings and establishes and
follows a schedule for
           regularly reviewing those holdings [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency, at least
           annually] to ensure that only PII identified in the notice is collected
and retained, and that the
           PII continues to be necessary to accomplish the legally authorized
purpose."
```

##### Privacy

Project does not collect or maintain PII and therefore does not directly address this control though it may address it indirectly. The data collected (email address, first and last name) is demonstrably a minimum.


### DM-2: DATA RETENTION AND DISPOSAL

```text
"The organization:
     a. Retains each collection of personally identifiable information (PII)
        for [Assignment: organization-defined time period] to fulfill the purpose(s) identified in the notice or as
        required by law;
     b. Disposes of, destroys, erases, and/or anonymizes the PII, regardless
        of the method of storage, in accordance with a NARA-approved record retention
        schedule and in a manner that prevents loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access; and
     c. Uses [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or methods] to ensure
        secure deletion or destruction of PII (including originals, copies, and 
        archived records)."
```

### DM-3: MINIMIZATION OF PII USED IN TESTING, TRAINING, AND RESEARCH

```text
"The organization:
     a.    Develops policies and procedures that minimize the use of personally identifiable information
           (PII) for testing, training, and research; and
     b.    Implements controls to protect PII used for testing, training, and research."
