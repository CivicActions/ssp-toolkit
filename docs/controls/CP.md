#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

The LINCS Technology Project has developed a contingency planning policy consistent with Department of Education, Handbook for Information Technology Security Contingency Planning Procedures (Handbook OCIO-10) and NIST 800-34. Contingency planning procedures are formally documented within the LINCS Technology Project Contingency Plan, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to contingency planning. The Department reviews and updates the policy as necessary and the policy was last updated in July 2012.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in Contingency Planning (CP) Policy and Procedure that can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.
