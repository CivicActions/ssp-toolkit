##### CivicActions

CivicActions has developed this system security plan (SSP) for the information system as part of compliance with NIST 800-53 and FIPS 199. The SSP defines the security categorization, system boundary, and security requirements and controls meeting the requirements of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). Specifically the SSP:

1. Is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture
2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system
3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions and business processes
4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale
5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or connections to other information systems
6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system
7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable
8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements including a rationale for the tailoring decisions
9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation


#### b

##### CivicActions

The SSP is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official prior to plan implementation. A copy of the SSP is provided to authorized CivicActions and assessing personnel including the System Owner, Authorizing Official, Information System Security Officer, System/Network Administrator, and the CivicActions Operations staff. The SSP is maintained by the CivicActions Security Office.


#### c

##### CivicActions

The SSP is reviewed at least annually by the System Owner and the CivicActions Operations staff in collaboration with the CivicActions Security Office.


#### d

##### CivicActions

The CivicActions Operations staff in collaboration with the CivicActions Security Office updates the system description and control descriptions within the SSP as needed to verify the SSP is an accurate description of the system.


#### e

##### CivicActions

The SSP is currently available to authorized users on GitLab. Per the Acceptable Use Policy, all entities granted access to CivicActions information assets are required to complete a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to uphold information confidentiality. GitLab provides the configuration management capabilities for the SSP to be protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification.


### PL-4: Rules Of Behavior

```text
The organization:
  a.  Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access
to the information system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to information and information system usage;
  b.  Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that
they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and the information system;
  c.  Reviews and updates the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency]; and
  d.  Requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of
behavior to read and re-sign when the rules of behavior are revised/updated.
```

**Status:** Complete

#### a

##### CivicActions

CivicActions has created and made readily available to individuals requiring access to the information system the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to information and information system usage. These rules, defined as the Acceptable Use Policy, are included in the CivicActions Security Policy accessible here: <https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/security/#acceptable-use-policy> which has also been uploaded to CSAM as ''Appendix J1 - System Rules of Behavior - Privileged User'' (CivicActions Security Policy 20190226.docx).'


#### b

##### CivicActions

CivicActions HR receives a signed acknowledgment from all employees, indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and the information system. The text of the electronically signed (via DocuSign) acknowledgment document has been uploaded to CSAM as artifact: ''CivicActions Security Policy Acknowledgement.docx''


#### c

##### CivicActions

CivicActions reviews the CivicActions Security Policy at least annually and updates as required.


#### d

##### CivicActions

CivicActions requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the CivicActions Security Policy to read and re-sign when any part of it, including the Acceptable Use Policy/Rules of Behavior, is revised/updated.
