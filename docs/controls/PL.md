#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

The LINCS Technology Project developed its security policy planning and procedures based on the Department of Education, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy, Information Assurance Program (Handbook OCIO-01), guidance from NIST, the Office of Management and Budget and industry best practices. Security policies and procedures are formally documented within the LINCS SSP, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to security planning. It provides guidance on all aspects of security for the protection of LINCS information technology resources. It defines responsibilities for the implementation and oversight of the guidance contained herein. The plan was last updated in December, 2015.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a system planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Planning (PL) Policy and Procedure document that can be found in the CivicActions Github repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud Service Provider dated 1 May 2013.
