##### CivicActions

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained by the CivicActions Identification and Authentication (IA) Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.


##### Project

The Project system owners/managers manage user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying each user; (ii) verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization to issue a user identifier from an appropriate official; (iv) ensuring that the user identifier is issued to the intended party; (v) disabling user identifier after a reasonable period of inactivity as documented in its security procedures; and (vi) archiving user identifiers. Project reviews and updates this policy as necessary.


### IA-2: Identification And Authentication (Organizational Users)

```text
The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).
```

##### AWS

AWS built-in features of Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides the capability for uniquely identifying and authenticating users and processes acting on their behalf to both organizational and non-organizational users operating within the AWS account and infrastructure, providing privileges based on the credentials, group memberships, and access policies assigned to them. The customer organization, at its discretion, provides individual user accounts and privileges to both organizational non-organizational users in addition to organizational users.


### IA-2 (1): Network Access To Privileged Accounts

```text
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### CivicActions

CivicActions system administrators employ a personal public- key pair for basic access and must originate from a whitelisted IP address. The whitelist is maintained by an Ansible inventory file, the current complete list (includes dev sites) of users with whitelisted IPs is in artifact: None

To access root (sudo) privileges an additional password is required. The passwords are maintained in encrypted form in the Ansible inventory file. The mechanism to enable select users to use a password to obtain root access can be viewed in artifact: None


##### Drupal

Drupal administrators and other roles with unrestricted access to live content and/or user accounts are required to use two-factor authentication. See artifact None


##### Project

The Project employs multi-factor authentication for privileged users.


### IA-2 (12): Acceptance Of Piv Credentials

```text
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials.
```

**Status:** None

##### Project

The Project system allows users to access the system using Common Access Cards (CAC).


### IA-4: Identifier Management

```text
The organization manages information system identifiers by:
  a.  Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
or roles] to assign an individual, group, role, or device identifier;
  b.  Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;
  c.  Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;
  d.  Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time
period]; and
  e.  Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period
of inactivity].
```

**Status:** Partial

**Summary:** Partially inherited from AWS (FedRAMP).

#### a

##### CivicActions

Access to the system is authorized by the System Owner or Project Manager for each role as described in AC-2.


##### Drupal

Upon account creation, the Drupal software assigns each user account a unique numerical user ID (UID). This UID is used internally by the system to track user actions such as content creation or editing. The numerical user IDs are never reused even if their user accounts are subsequently blocked or deleted.


##### Ilias

Upon account creation, the Ilias software assigns each user account a unique numerical user ID (UID). This UID is used internally by the system to track user actions such as content creation or editing. The numerical user IDs are never reused even if their user accounts are subsequently blocked or deleted.

#### b

##### CivicActions

User accounts are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a unique username, password and email address based on the system for allocating user accounts described in AC-2.

In accordance with CivicActions Identification and Authentication (IA) Policy outlined at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>, CivicActions internal users are uniquely identified by the creation of an organizational account with a username based on each user's first and last names.


##### Drupal

When Drupal user accounts are created, users' email addresses are verified by sending a single-use activation link to the user’s mailbox. The email recipient then uses the activation link to log in to the website and supply a password which must meet the system's password complexity requirements.


##### Ilias

When Ilias user accounts are created, users' email addresses are verified by sending a single-use activation link to the user’s mailbox. The email recipient then uses the activation link to log in to the website and supply a password which must meet the system's password complexity requirements.

#### c

##### CivicActions

User accounts are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a unique username, password and email address based on the system for allocating user accounts described in AC-2.


##### Drupal

Identifiers for CivicActions internal personnel include a username based on the individual's full first and last name and are reviewed for uniqueness by the admin group when it approves the creation of the user account.


##### Ilias

Identifiers for CivicActions internal personnel include a username based on the individual's full first and last name and are reviewed for uniqueness by the admin group when it approves the creation of the user account.

#### d

##### CivicActions

Account usernames may not be re-used for at least two years.

##### Drupal

Drupal user's unique identifier (the numeric user ID, or UID) is never reused.

##### Ilias

Ilias user's unique identifier (the numeric user ID, or UID) is never reused.

#### e

##### CivicActions

All user accounts are required to change their passwords every 90 days. The website will automatically block the accounts of users who fail to change their password within that time period, after which the account may only be unblocked by a website Administrator or CivicActions Operations staff.


### IA-5: Authenticator Management

```text
The organization manages information system authenticators by:
  a.  Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity
of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;
  b.  Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by
the organization;
  c.  Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their
intended use;
  d.  Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator
distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
  e.  Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;
  f.  Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions
for authenticators;
  g.  Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time
period by authenticator type];
  h.  Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
  i.  Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security
safeguards to protect authenticators; and
  j.  Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those
accounts changes.
```

**Status:** Partial

**Summary:** Partially inherited from AWS (FedRAMP).

#### a

##### Drupal

Refer to control AC-2 in this SSP for further details on account provisioning.
CivicActions will create and maintain an initial Drupal Administrator (highest level of Drupal Account). New Administrators are able to provide additional Administrator access at their own discretion and are ultimately responsible for managing their own Administrator and other user accounts that they create.


##### Ilias

Refer to control AC-2 in this SSP for further details on account provisioning.
CivicActions will create and maintain an initial Ilias Administrator (highest level of Ilias Account). New Administrators are able to provide additional Administrator access at their own discretion and are ultimately responsible for managing their own Administrator and other user accounts that they create.


##### Project

Authentication for Project internal personnel are created during the personnel assignment process where requests are made to the Project admin group for proper access levels. The Project admin group verifies the identity of the user. The website performs further verification by sending an email to the user's mailbox containing a single-use activation link which must be used to log in to the account for the first time and to create a password.


#### b

##### Drupal

Initial authenticator content (a unique email address – not previously used in any other account) is provided by the user. Internal initial password requirements set by CivicActions Operations and ongoing password refreshes by internal users follow the requirements set in the Identification and Authentication Policy.


##### Ilias

Initial authenticator content (a unique email address – not previously used in any other account) is provided by the user. Internal initial password requirements set by CivicActions Operations and ongoing password refreshes by internal users follow the requirements set in the Identification and Authentication Policy.

##### Project

Project admins in collaboration with CivicActions Operations are responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts in compliance with the authentication requirements described herein.


#### c

##### Drupal

The system partially inherits this control from Drupal standard password strength mechanisms.

##### Ilias

The system partially inherits this control from Ilias standard password strength mechanisms.

##### Project

When entering a user account password upon initial login, all users must comply with the following password policies, which are enforced by the website's software configuration:

- Password must be at least 14 characters in length.
- Password must contain at least one digit.
- Password must contain at least one special character (not whitespace or an alphanumeric).
- Password must contain at least one uppercase character.
- Password must contain at least one lowercase character.


#### d

##### Drupal

The system partially inherits this control from Drupal standard password management. All password creation/change/reset operations are recorded in the website's "Drupal Watchdog" logs.


##### Ilias

The system partially inherits this control from Ilias standard password management.
All password creation/change/reset operations are recorded in the website's Ilias logs.


##### Project

Project is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts, which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the website's software configuration, as described in IA-5(d).

In accordance with Project site configuration, the following administrative procedures exist for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.

- Initial authenticator distribution: Users receive a one-time login link
  by email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log
  in and then must enter a password themselves which complies with the
  password complexity requirements described in IA-4(b).

- Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators: Users who have forgotten their
  password may request a new password by submitting their username or
  email address. The website responds by emailing a one-time login link
  to the user's email address. After using the link to log in, the user
  is required to enter a new password.

- Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in
  the last 90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators may block
  any user account if they believe there is a reason to do so.


#### e

##### Drupal

Drupal requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the application website enforces this. Each user account is assigned a default password that is randomly generated, not possible to guess, and not shared with anyone, including site administrators. When the user logs in and creates a new password, the default password is erased from the website database.


##### Ilias

Ilias requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the application website enforces this. Each user account is assigned a default password that is randomly generated, not possible to guess, and not shared with anyone, including site administrators. When the user logs in and creates a new password, the default password is erased from the website database.

#### f

##### Project

Project authenticators follow these password lifetime restrictions:

- Maximum password age = 90
- Minimum password age = 1
- Password reuse restriction = 10


#### g

##### Project

Project enforces password lifetime restrictions. The password lifetime settings for internal accounts is as follows:

- Minimum restriction of zero (1) days and
- Maximum restriction of ninety (90) days before a password change is required.


#### h

##### Drupal

For all Drupal users, passwords are protected by the website's software, which only stores an encrypted string based on the password. This means that even if the website's database should be compromised, an attacker would still be unable to know users' actual passwords. Internal users receive training in security awareness and acceptable use and are instructed never to reveal their passwords to anyone.


##### Ilias

For all Ilias users, passwords are protected by the website's software, which only stores an encrypted string based on the password. This means that even if the website's database should be compromised, an attacker would still be unable to know users' actual passwords. Internal users receive training in security awareness and acceptable use and are instructed never to reveal their passwords to anyone.

#### i

##### CivicActions
