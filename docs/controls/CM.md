> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-1>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The configuration management policy and procedures are formally documented in the LINCS Technology Project Configuration Management Plan (CMP), which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to physical and environmental protection. It defines responsibilities for the implementation and oversight of the guidance contained herein. The Department reviews and updates the policy as necessary.

Additional information is contained within the Department of Education, Handbook forInformation Technology Security Configuration Management Planning Procedures (Handbook OCIO-11).



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Configuration Management (CM) Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.

Configuration changes are overseen by the Change Control Board (CCB) consisting of the System Owner, Project Manager and CivicActions Development.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud Service Providers dated 1 May 2013.



## CM-02 BASELINE CONFIGURATION

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

A CM process has been established and documented in the LINCS Technology Project CMP. All updates are made in accordance with the procedures outlined in the CMP.  The CM process establishes a baseline of hardware, software, firmware and documentation, as well as changes thereto, throughout the development and life cycle of the information system. CM ensures the control of the information system through its life cycle. It assures that additions, deletions, or changes made to the LINCS Technology Project system do not unintentionally or unknowingly diminish security. If the change is major, the security of the system must be re-analyzed.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

A current baseline configuration is always available - stored as a tag in the Git repository - such that the site can be regenerated or rolled back should unauthorized or failing changes be applied.



#### Drupal specific control support

The baseline configuration is maintained in Git and described in the Configuration Management Plan, which describes the change workflow and software configuration. In the context of Security Configuration Management, the baseline configuration is a collection of formally approved configuration state(s) of one or more configuration items ("features") that compose the system. The baseline configuration is used to restore and serves as the basis against which the next change or set of changes to the system is made.

The features for the system are maintained in the website's source code, which is managed in git, a source code version control system. Once the source code is updated, git maintains the new version of staged code once committed in the git repository as the new baseline. All code prior to it being staged is documented, tested and approved by CivicActions Development, which is described in control SA-3. The production environment is configured to take database snapshots daily.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

Hardware Baselines

All hardware is maintained by AWS Cloud. The system therefore inherits hardware configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration.



## CM-02 (1) REVIEWS AND UPDATES

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions reviews and updates baseline configurations for the system at least annually, when requested by the System Owner or required by law, and as an integral part of information system component installations, upgrades and maintenance.

Review of the CM baselines for the system is conducted and approved by CivicActions Development. Any changes made to the production environment are approved prior to deployment by the CCB or agile scrum process. Changes that may require updates to the baseline configuration for the application include:

* Significant upgrades or changes to applications or database software

* Security assessment findings

* Changes in internal/external security requirements

* A new security threat, incident, or event



## CM-02 (2) AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR ACCURACY / CURRENCY

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal configuration settings use automated mechanisms to automate code deployment and baseline settings changes. The website's baseline configuration may be reapplied to the site at any time by manually retriggering a tagged code deployment.

The source code, which contains the siteâ€™s baseline configuration, is managed using git, a source code version control system. Git is used to track source code which allows administrators to easily deploy and roll back changes on production hosting environments.

The Features module is used to export configuration settings from the website's MySQL database and stores them as code so that the configuration settings can be managed within the git source code version control system.



## CM-02 (3) RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

Previous baseline configurations are retained in git, which implements unlimited revision control. Each version of the codebase is given a unique tag when it is deployed to production. When new features are ready for deployment to production, the new code release is given a new tag. This makes it possible to roll back to a previous version of the baseline configuration if needed by redeploying the older release tag.



## CM-03 CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-3>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the Configuration Management Plan and control SA-3, CivicActions manages changes to the baseline configuration of the application through an agile scrum-based process.  Examples of the types of changes that may be introduced through a code release include the following, ordered by increasing level of possible security risk:

1. Minor application code changes

2. New software releases for Drupal core, contributed Drupal modules, or other software components that are supplied by outside open source vendors

3. Significant software enhancement

4. Major application modification

The CCB meets bi-weekly during the sprint planning and backlog grooming meetings. In addition, the System Owner or Project Manager may convene the CCB in an emergency session to address time-critical topics as deemed necessary.



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the Configuration Management Plan, CivicActions performs security impact analysis of all planned code releases. Level of impact is assessed by CivicActions Development in collaboration with CivicActions Security before the planned code updates are presented at the sprint planning meeting for approval. Significant software enhancements and major application modifications require approval from the Tech Lead of the Development team. Once a code release is considered ready for deployment, a Security Review is done before scheduling deployment of the code release to production, in accordance with the Agile-based System Development Life Cycle methodology described in SA-3.



### Part c)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

Configuration changes follow the CivicActions sprint planning process. The changes themselves are documented within a JIRA ticket tracking system. The JIRA ticket has an approval step built into the ticketing workflow that is required before the implementation phase. The CCB (agile sprint planning process) is responsible for reviewing the change and either approving or rejecting the proposal. These workflow changes are captured within an audit log in the ticket, and are available to anyone viewing the ticket.



### Part d)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

See part b). Configuration changes are captured within tickets in the CivicActions ticketing system. Each CR follows a specific workflow within the ticketing system that follows our process:

1. Open (Backlog)

2. To Do

3. In Progress

4. QA

5. Signoff

All CRs must be approved before they are applied to the information system.



### Part e)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All changes are logged and retained for a minimum of three years in the ticketing system. The Change Request (CR) tickets contain a detailed record of the steps taken to implement the change, as well as dates of approval and implementation.



### Part f)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All changes are logged and retained for a minimum of three years in the ticketing system. The Change Request (CR) tickets contain a detailed record of the steps taken to implement the change, as well as dates of approval and implementation.



### Part g)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

The CivicActions Change Control Board (or agile Sprint Planning team) meets bi-weekly, or when operational or security imperatives require, to address requested changes to the application.

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-3>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions tests and validates changes to the system before implementing the changes in production. Changes are documented as code and comments in the git source code version control system. Any changes made to system are first captured in a separate development branch of git that is used to create a pull request, which is reviewed for quality and security control before being merged into the master branch of the repository.



## CM-04 SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-4>

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

An Information Security Program is in place to ensure all security-centric impacts to the LINCS Technology Project are properly analyzed and conducted by personnel with information security responsibilities (i.e., LINCS SSO, IT Security Officer, etc.). These individuals have the appropriate skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to the LINCS Technology Project and their associated security ramifications. In support of continuous monitoring and to ensure the LINCS Technology system lifecycle is fully sustained, a risk assessment process, be it formal or informal, is performed when changes are occur. This ensures the Department understands the security impacts and can determine if additional security controls are required.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

Security impact analysis is conducted and documented within the Change Request (CR) process described in in CM-3(b). All proposed configuration-controlled changes to the application are tested first in a sandboxed development environment before being pushed to a staging environment to be tested by another developer and by the Engineering team prior to final approval from CCB to move changes to the production environment.



## CM-05 ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE
