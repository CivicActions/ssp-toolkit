## CM-02 BASELINE CONFIGURATION

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The application software component of lincs.ed.gov consists of (1) the DKAN distribution of the Drupal web application platform, with (2) additional software features that were developed expressly for lincs.ed.gov based on specifications provided by LINCS.

Baseline configuration for the website's standard DKAN features is stored in the website's codebase and managed using the Features module for Drupal (<https://www.drupal.org/project/features>). Site administrators can view the list of features by visiting the site's features management page at https://www.lincs.ed.gov/admin/structure/features. Most of the configuration for additional features that were developed specifically for lincs.ed.gov is also managed using the Drupal Features module.

The Features module makes it possible to override configuration for individual features without modifying the codebase. It stores those overridden features in the website's MySQL database. The features management page referenced above shows which components of each feature are based on the default configuration stored in code, and shows which components have been overridden in the database. Most components of lincs.ed.gov are based on the default configuration stored in code, but there are approximately a dozen components that have overrides stored in the database.

CivicActions maintains documentation describing each custom feature for lincs.ed.gov that is not standard DKAN, as well as documentation describing feature components that have overrides stored in the database.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The baseline configuration is described in Section 3.2 of the Configuration Management Plan, which describes the approved configuration of the LINCS system including all of its hardware, software, and firmware components and the physical and logical locations of each. In the context of Security Configuration Management, the baseline configuration is a collection of formally approved configuration state(s) of one or more configuration items ("features") that compose the LINCS system. The baseline configuration is used by LINCS to restore and serves as the basis against which the next change or set of changes to the LINCS is made.

The features for the LINCS system are maintained in the website's source code, which is managed in git, a source code version control system. Once the source code is updated, git maintains the new version of staged code once committed in the git repository as the new baseline. All code prior to it being staged is documented, tested and approved by CivicActions' DKAN Engineering team, which is described in control SA-3. The LINCS production environment is configured to take database snapshots daily.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system therefore inherits server configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration for IaaS components.

Hardware Baselines

All hardware is maintained by AWS Cloud. The system therefore inherits hardware configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration.

Server Configuration

AWS maintains the baseline software configuration for the server components required to run the Drupal platform upon which the system is built.



## CM-02 (1) REVIEWS AND UPDATES

### Part b)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Review of the CM baselines for the LINCS system is conducted and approved by the DKAN Engineering team. Any changes made to the production environment are approved prior to deployment by the LINCS CCB. Changes that may require updates to the baseline configuration for the lincs.ed.gov application include:

* Significant upgrades or changes to applications or database software

* Security assessment findings

* Changes in internal/external security requirements

* A new security threat, incident, or event

## CM-02 (2) AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR ACCURACY / CURRENCY

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS configuration settings use automated mechanisms to automate code deployment and baseline settings changes. The website's baseline configuration may be reapplied to the site at any time by manually retriggering a code deployment using the AWS dashboard.

The source code, which contains the siteâ€™s baseline configuration, is managed using git, a source code version control system. Git is used to track source code which allows administrators to easily deploy and roll back changes on production hosting environments.

The Features module (described above under "Application Configuration") is used to export configuration settings from the website's MySQL database and stores them as code so that the configuration settings can be managed within the git source code version control system.



## CM-02 (3) RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

Previous baseline configurations are retained in git, which implements unlimited revision control. Each version of the codebase is given a unique tag when it is deployed to production. When new features are ready for deployment to production, the new code release is given a new tag. This makes it possible to roll back to a previous version of the baseline configuration if needed by redeploying the older release tag.



## CM-03 CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-3>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the Configuration Management Plan and control SA-3, CivicActions releases changes to the baseline configuration of the application through planned point releases, which bundle multiple new features, and feature changes into a single planned code releases. Point releases occur roughly every two months. Since they bundle multiple new features into a single release, Examples of the types of changes that may be introduced through a code release include the following, ordered by increasing level of possible security risk:

1. Minor application code changes

2. New software releases for Drupal core, contributed Drupal modules, or other software components that are supplied by outside open source vendors

3. Significant software enhancement

4. Major application modification



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the Configuration Management Plan, CivicActions performs security impact analysis of all planned code releases. Level of impact is assessed by the Engineering team before the planned code release is presented to the Change Control Board (CCB) for final approval. Significant software enhancements and major application modifications require approval from the Tech Lead of the Engineering team. Once a code release is considered ready for deployment, a CCB Review is done before scheduling deployment of the code release to production, in accordance with the Agile-based System Development Life Cycle methodology described



### Part c)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

Configuration changes follow the CivicActions CCB process. The changes themselves are documented clearly within a Change Request (CR) ticket in the CivicActions (JIRA or Git) ticketing system. The CR ticket has an approval step built into the ticketing workflow that is required before the implementation phase. The CCB is responsible for reviewing the change and either approving (all members of the CCB must come to a consensus) or rejecting the proposal. These workflow changes are captured within an audit log in the ticket, and are available to anyone viewing the ticket.



### Part d)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

See part b). Configuration changes are captured within tickets in the CivicActions ticketing system. Each CR follows a specific workflow within the ticketing system that follows our process:

1. Open

2. In testing

3. In peer review

4. Waiting for approval

5. Approved OR Rejected

6. Successful OR Unsuccessful

All CRs must be approved before they are applied to the information system.



### Part e)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All changes are logged and retained for a minimum of three years in the ticketing system. The Change Request (CR) tickets contain a detailed record of the steps taken to implement the change, as well as dates of approval and implementation.



### Part f)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All changes are logged and retained for a minimum of three years in the ticketing system. The Change Request (CR) tickets contain a detailed record of the steps taken to implement the change, as well as dates of approval and implementation.



### Part g)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

The CivicActions Change Control Board meets weekly, or when operational or security imperatives require, to address requested changes to the application.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The Change Control Board (CCB) is a group containing two individuals (at a minimum) that have the collective responsibility and authority to review and approve proposed change to the LINCS system. The LINCS OCIO Policy for Information Systems Security and Privacy Handbook requires that the configuration management process include the system CA (Certification Authority) or a representative from that system as a member of the CCB. The LINCS CCB shall meet regularly at a time and place set by the LINCS CCB Chair.  In addition, the LINCS CCB Chair may convene the LINCS CCB in an emergency session to address time-critical topics as deemed necessary.

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-3>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions tests and validates changes to the system before implementing the changes in production. Changes are documented as comments in the git source code version control system. Any changes made to LINCS are first captured in a separate development branch of git that is used to create a pull request, which is reviewed for quality control before being merged into the master branch of the repository.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

Before deployment to production, the code in the master branch of the repository is deployed to a staging server hosted by AWS where it the code changes are reviewed again. After all code changes have been reviewed and tested on the staging server, the code release is presented to the CCB for approval before the code is tagged for release and deployed to the production server.



## CM-04 SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS
