### MA-1: System Maintenance Policy And Procedures

```text
The organization:
  a.  Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined
personnel or roles]:
    1.  A system maintenance policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    2.  Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system maintenance
policy and associated system maintenance controls; and
  b.  Reviews and updates the current:
    1.  System maintenance policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
and
    2.  System maintenance procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
```

**Status:** Partial

**Summary:** Partially inherited from AWS (FedRAMP).

##### AWS

This System Maintenance control associated with hardware components within AWS is generally either partially or fully inherited from the AWS physical infrastructure, while the customer organization is responsible for any part of the control that is applicable to customer-controlled equipment and facilities, and the customer's configurable portion of the AWS logical infrastructure, including the Operating systems on Amazon EC2 instances and the customer's applications.

For the U.S. East, U.S. West, and GovCloud regions, this control is inherited from pre-existing Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) or JAB provisional Authority to Operate under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).

Refer to the AWS FedRAMP SSP artifacts, including the Control Implementation Summary and Customer Responsibility Matrix, available from the AWS Compliance Team. http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/


##### CivicActions

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a system maintenance policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Maintenance (MA) Policy and Procedure document that can be found in the CivicActions GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.


##### Project

System maintenance policy and procedures are formally documented in the Project SSP, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to software and systems maintenance and updates. The The Project ensures that maintenance controls are developed, disseminated, reviewed, and updated as necessary.

Physical and environmental protection is fully inherited from the AWS FedRAMP certified us-east cloud.

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.


### MA-2: Controlled Maintenance

```text
The organization:
  a.  Schedules, performs, documents, and reviews records of maintenance and repairs
on information system components in accordance with manufacturer or vendor specifications and/or organizational requirements;
  b.  Approves and monitors all maintenance activities, whether performed on site
or remotely and whether the equipment is serviced on site or removed to another location;
  c.  Requires that [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] explicitly
approve the removal of the information system or system components from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs;
  d.  Sanitizes equipment to remove all information from associated media prior
to removal from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs;
  e.  Checks all potentially impacted security controls to verify that the controls
are still functioning properly following maintenance or repair actions; and
  f.  Includes [Assignment: organization-defined maintenance-related information]
in organizational maintenance records.
```

##### Project

The Project schedules, performs, and documents regular maintenance on the software components of all systems, including but not limited to:

- Hourly automated snapshot backups
- Daily disaster recovery remote backups
- Daily Intrusion Detection (OSSEC) / Data Integrity Assurance (AIDE)
- As needed help desk support
- Twice-monthly OS updates/patches


### MA-4: Nonlocal Maintenance

```text
The organization:
  a.  Approves and monitors nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;
  b.  Allows the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent
with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the information system;
  c.  Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance
and diagnostic sessions;
  d.  Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
  e.  Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is
completed.
```

**Status:** Partial

**Summary:** Partially inherited from AWS (FedRAMP).

#### a

##### CivicActions

System maintenance is done from remote sites as there is no direct access to the server instances in the AWS cloud; this is the government-approved method of doing business. Approval, QA, and monitoring are conducted by the team performing the specific maintenance.


#### b

##### CivicActions

Remote diagnostics tools, such as OSSEC, AIDE, fail2ban, and OpenSCAP are used to verify the integrity of files, perform log analysis, monitor login attempts and check for rootkits and other vulnerabilities.


#### c

##### CivicActions

All nonlocal maintenance requires the same authentication requirements to perform the maintenance activities to access the system as defined in controls AC-3 and IA-2. SSH is used to secure all communications between the remote user and the components located in the AWS cloud.


#### d

##### CivicActions

CivicActions records for nonlocal maintenance is managed through JIRA tickets and the Git issue queue as well as normal system logs. CivicActions administrator activity to the system is also logged through the implementation of the AU-2 (Audit Events) and AU-3 (Content of Audit Records).


#### e

##### CivicActions

Any session for internal maintenance activities is terminated when the user completes their session, disconnects from the system, or logs out. In addition, sessions are terminated after 15 minutes of inactivity.


### MA-5: Maintenance Personnel

```text
The organization:
  a.  Establishes a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintains
a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel;
  b.  Ensures that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the information
system have required access authorizations; and
  c.  Designates organizational personnel with required access authorizations
and technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access authorizations.
```

##### CivicActions

Maintenance of the system and applications can only be performed by personnel designated as having internal administrator privileges and responsibilities. Access rights for the internal administrators are assigned and granted access to perform their specific job responsibilities. All physical maintenance requirements are inherited from AWS.


##### Project

Client maintains a list of authorized contract (CivicActions) personnel who perform maintenance and repair activities on the Project Project system components, and only these authorized personnel may perform the maintenance. All maintenance personnel have the required personnel security elements in place.
