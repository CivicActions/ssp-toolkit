##### AWS

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: AWS account management.


#### a

##### AWS

In this architecture, a baseline set of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups and roles are created, with associated access policies, to support alignment of user accounts to personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform management (e.g. Billing, EC2/VPC/RDS systems administration, I.T. auditing, etc.)


##### CivicActions

CivicActions Operations staff, in collaboration with CivicActions' Security Office, will set up privileged accounts for the following roles:

- Developer - a user-level account that has access to application features and sanitized databases
- System Administrator - user accounts that enjoy full system administrator access


##### SSH

Operations, in collaboration with the Security Office, will set up privileged accounts accounts for the following roles:
- Developer - user level account that has access to application features and sanitized databases
- System Administrator - user accounts that enjoy full system administrator (`sudo`) access


#### b

##### CivicActions

CivicActions' Project Manager assigns the "administrator" role for the management of all accounts issued to internal admin roles supporting the information system. Account requests are initiated by the Project Manager by completing a ticket request and the CivicActions Operation staff manages the entire account creation process.


##### Drupal

Drupal defines a default set of roles; Anonymous, Authenticated, and Administrator, as well as providing for the creation of additional organizational-defined roles identified by The Project


#### d

##### CivicActions

All accounts issued for application administrators and SSH are documented in CivicActions' ticketing system. Account request tickets contain details that explain the attributes for the account including authorized users of Drupal, system infrastructure, group and role membership, and access authorizations.


##### Drupal

Drupal has a sophisticated permissions and role-based access control built-in. Each role within Drupal can only access the documents and controls for which their privilege allows.

#### e

##### CivicActions

All accounts issued for the admin management of Application or SSH access must be approved by the System Owner or Project Manager who must create an account request. The CivicActions Operations staff applies appropriate account permissions and settings based on the job role and function documented within the request ticket using processes defined by the CivicActions' Security Office.

#### f

##### CivicActions

CivicActions Operations staff is responsible for the following account management activities for both internal administrative users and customer accounts:

- Establishing account justification
- Activating accounts
- Modifying accounts
- Expiring accounts
- Disabling accounts
- Removing accounts


#### g

##### AWS

In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail and Amazon S3 Bucket logging are enabled, which provides the audit trail capability for the organization to monitor the use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts. An Amazon S3 bucket centrally contains the CloudTrail audit logs. Amazon CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send an alert when an API call is made to create, update or delete a Network ACL/Security Group, when Root user activity detected, when multiple API actions or login attempts fail, when IAM Configuration changes are detected, when new IAM access key was created and when changes to the CloudTrail log configuration is detected


##### CivicActions

All CivicActions systems log the usage of information accounts.

##### Drupal

Drupal monitors the usage of information accounts in the Watchdog log.

#### h

##### CivicActions

In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC-01) Policy when an account is no longer required, the Project Manager notifies the Operations Team to immediately disable all access. Users upon reassignment, change in roles, termination, or leaving employment are initially removed from all roles and groups, effectively denying them all access to privileged accounts.


#### i

##### CivicActions

System accounts require access authorizations prior to accounts being created. The Project Manager must initiate an access request for an account to be created. CivicActions Operations staff reviews the request to ensure accuracy, including intended system usage and other attributes of the user access being requested.


#### j

##### CivicActions

All privileged accounts are reviewed by CivicActions Operations staff every 180 days.


#### k

##### CivicActions

In accordance with standard security best practices and CivicActions policy, shared and reissued accounts for internal accounts of any kind are not created nor used for any purpose in any system.


### AC-3: Access Enforcement

```text
The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information           and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### AWS

In this architecture, AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon S3 enforce access to the AWS infrastructure and data in S3 buckets. A baseline set of IAM groups are created, with associated access policies to support alignment of user accounts to personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform management (e.g. Billing, EC2/ VPC/RDS systems administration, I.T. auditing, etc.) Login/API access is restricted to those users for whom the organization has authorized and created or federated IAM user accounts, and assigned the appropriate IAM group and/or role membership. Amazon S3 buckets have specific access control policies assigned to restrict access to those IAM users who are assigned the appropriate IAM roles/groups.


##### Drupal

Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via a unique username/password for every type of user except Anonymous user. The userâ€™s privileges, permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.
The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.


### AC-6: Least Privilege

```text
The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.
```

##### SSH

SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are reported and reviewed by the Security Office and evaluated to determine roles that need to be revoked.

### AC-7: Unsuccessful Logon Attempts

```text
The information system:
  a.  Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive
invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
  b.  Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined
time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
```

**Status:** Complete

#### a

##### Drupal

Drupal can be configured to lock an account after a specified number of invalid login attempts within a specified time period. The default for Drupal is 5 failed login attempts within six hours.

#### b

##### Drupal

Lockdown following unsuccessful attempts is configurable by Drupal administrators to conform to defined requirements. When a user exceeds the limit of invalid login attempts, their account is automatically locked for a specified time and requires administrator action to unlock the account before the lockout period expires.

### AC-14: Permitted Actions Without Identification Or Authentication

```text
The organization:
  a.  Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be performed
on the information system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational missions/business functions; and
  b.  Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the
information system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.
```

**Status:** Complete

#### a

##### Drupal

The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. Drupal sites can be configured to allow actions identified by The Project


### AC-17: Remote Access

```text
The organization:
  a.  Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements,
and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and
  b.  Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such
connections.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### CivicActions

The CivicActions Access Control (AC) policy defines policy for remote usage restrictions. The Project Manager or System Owner may additionally provision users according to their Access Control policies.


### AC-18: Wireless Access
