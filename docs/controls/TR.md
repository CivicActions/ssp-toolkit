```text
"The organization:
     a.    Publishes System of Records Notices (SORNs) in the Federal Register,

           oversight processes, for systems containing personally identifiable
information (PII);

     c.    Includes Privacy Act Statements on its forms that collect PII, or on

           retained by individuals, to provide additional formal notice to individuals
