#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Audit and Accountability (AU) Policy.  This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The Department of Education developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management committment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance, and developed, documented and disseminated to personnel procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.The policy is stated in the Office of the Secretary Information Security Policy dated July 17, 2013 and the procedures are defined in the Office of the Secretary Procedures Handbook for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents will be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to the LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating the Audit and Accountability Policy and Procedures annually. The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for approving Audit and Accountability. All procedures are consistent with requirements of FISMA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, applicable executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. These policies and procedures are applicable to the CivicActions staff administering the lincs.ed.gov information system.

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AU-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions' Security Policy provides information about auditing and logging of CivicActions internal users and end-user activity on the servers and within the system application.



#### Drupal specific control support

Transaction logs are generated by the Apache web server, Drupal CMS, MySQL database and PHP page processing.  Specifically, the following server, application, database and network device audit log events are captured:

* Apache access log :: Contains a list of requests for your website that have bypassed Varnish. These requests include pages, theme files, and static media files.

* Apache error log :: Records any Apache-level issues. The issues reported here are usually caused by general server issues, including capacity problems, .htaccess problems, and missing files.

* Drupal page request log :: Records all Drupal page loads on your website.

* Drupal watchdog log :: Records Drupal-related actions on your website. The watchdog log is recorded on your server if you have enabled the syslog module.

* MySQL slow query log :: Contains a list of MySQL queries that have taken longer than one second to complete.

* PHP error log :: Records any issues that occur during the PHP processing portion of a page load. Issues reported here are usually caused by a website’s code, configuration, or content.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

Transaction logs are generated by the AWS Cloud, so this system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following:  audit events for the AWS platform. Specifically, AWS is responsible for logging the following server, application, database and network device audit log events:

* Apache access log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* Apache error log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* Drupal page request log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* Drupal watchdog log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* PHP error log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* MySQL slow query log :: Since slow query logs are stored in a root-only MySQL directory on your servers, you can only download them using the Cloud > Logs page, and you cannot access them directly on the server. For more information, see Downloading your slow query log and Tools for parsing a slow query log.

* Varnish log :: Notes which requests have been served by Varnish cache and which were not. Since most customers use shared load balancers, Varnish logs are only available via the Log Streaming feature and cannot be downloaded from either the Insight website or your servers.



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

Auditable events may change due to changes in the threat environment. CivicActions teams collaborate internally and also communicate with customers and partner organizations to identify and select auditable events. The teams that participate in this process are described in control SA-3(b).



#### Drupal specific control support

All security-related issues and events, including requests for server log analysis, are recorded in CivicActions' JIRA tracking system.



### Part c)

#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions has extensive experience and specialization as a host of websites that are built using the Drupal web hosting platform. Our list of auditable events is also informed by the experience and advice of Drupal's security team, which receives security vulnerability reports and publishes security updates related to Drupal and the more than 1 million websites that use the Drupal platform.  Should the need for additional logging become evident, we have the ability to do so by modifying the website's source code to insert additional Drupal watchdog hooks.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: automatic event logging is largely the responsibility of the AWS Cloud vendor.

* Drupal request logs: Captures all requests passed to the Drupal application

* Drupal watchdog: Captures additional details of significant transactions processed by Drupal, such as the username of a login attempts

* PHP error logs: Captures any errors logged during execution of the PHP programming language

* Node revision history: Captures each revision made to a piece of content on the website

Information captured in the transaction logs includes, but is not limited to, the following auditable events:

* Failed login attempts

* Successful login attempts

* User account deletions

* User account blocking/unblocking

* Changes in user role assignments

When auditing a Drupal incident, CivicActions' developers aggregate log sources from multiple servers into spreadsheets so that all log entries for a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document.  Log sources are manually sorted, filtered and reviewed.  Application logs are maintained primarily for after-the-fact investigation of critical system or security events.
