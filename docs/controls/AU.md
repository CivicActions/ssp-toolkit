##### CivicActions

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Audit and Accountability (AU) Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.


##### Project

The Project maintains a record of system activity by application process and by user activity. Audit and accountability policy and procedures are documented within the Project SSP. Security software features are used to automatically generate and store security audit log records for use in monitoring security-related events on all multi-user systems. The Client reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it was last updated in April 2008. Additional information is contained within the None.


### AU-2: Audit Events

```text
The organization:
  a.  Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following
events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events];
  b.  Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities
requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;
  c.  Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate
to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and
  d.  Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information
system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].
