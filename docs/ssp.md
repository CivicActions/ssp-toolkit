```

**Status:** Complete

##### CivicActions

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Access Control (AC) Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.


##### Project

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

Access control policy and procedures are documented in the The Project SSP. Access to Project operational information or system resources is limited to only authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access control policies to protect the integrity of the The Project. This Department reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated, as necessary, since April 2008.


### AC-2: Account Management

```text
The organization:
  a.  Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts
to support organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment: organization-defined information system account types];
  b.  Assigns account managers for information system accounts;
  c.  Establishes conditions for group and role membership;
  d.  Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership,
and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;
  e.  Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
for requests to create information system accounts;
  f.  Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts
in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions];
  g.  Monitors the use of information system accounts;
  h.  Notifies account managers:
    1.  When accounts are no longer required;
    2.  When users are terminated or transferred; and
    3.  When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;
  i.  Authorizes access to the information system based on:
    1.  A valid access authorization;
    2.  Intended system usage; and
    3.  Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business
functions;
  j.  Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and
  k.  Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if
deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### AWS

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: AWS account management.


#### a

##### AWS

In this architecture, the baseline AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups and roles are associated with access policies to align user accounts with personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform management (e.g. Billing, Amazon EC2/VPC/Amazon RDS systems administration, I.T. auditing, etc.)


##### CivicActions

CivicActions Operations staff, in collaboration with CivicActions' Security Office, will set up privileged accounts for the following roles:

- Developer - a user-level account that has access to application features and sanitized databases
- System Administrator - user accounts that enjoy full system administrator access


##### Ilias

Ilias provides user accounts for individuals who participate in visiting, contributing to and administering the site with the following roles:
- Anonymous user – Readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not logged in.
- Guest – This role has limited visibility and read permissions
- User - Standard role for registered users. This role grants read access to most objects.
- Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.


##### Project

SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.

Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain areas of the Project system. User access is controlled by the completion and submission of Project system Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial account is created. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support contractor review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from the system by the system administrator.

The Project has implemented user account procedures to disable inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The Project support staff monitors all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication Management, of the Project SSP illustrates the exact procedures the contractor support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.
The Project system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.


##### SSH

Operations, in collaboration with the Security Office, will set up privileged accounts accounts for the following roles:
- Developer - user level account that has access to application features and sanitized databases
- System Administrator - user accounts that enjoy full system administrator (`sudo`) access


#### b

##### CivicActions

CivicActions' Project Manager assigns the "administrator" role for the management of all accounts issued to internal admin roles supporting the information system. Account requests are initiated by the Project Manager by completing a ticket request and the CivicActions Operation staff manages the entire account creation process.


##### Drupal

Drupal defines a default set of roles; Anonymous, Authenticated, and Administrator, as well as providing for the creation of additional organizational-defined roles identified by The Project


##### Project

The system Owner has oversight over all permissions that the Project Manager and Operations Staff manages.


#### c

##### Project

In accordance with Project Access Control Policy, Project group membership is determined according to the individual's position and role within the organization. A ticket request is used to request accounts and group membership. The request is authorized by the appropriate manager.


#### d

##### CivicActions

All accounts issued for application administrators and SSH are documented in CivicActions' ticketing system. Account request tickets contain details that explain the attributes for the account including authorized users of Drupal, system infrastructure, group and role membership, and access authorizations.


##### Drupal

Drupal has a sophisticated permissions and role-based access control built-in. Each role within Drupal can only access the documents and controls for which their privilege allows.

##### Ilias

Ilias' permissions and role-based access controls are built-in. Each role within Ilias can only access the pages and controls for which their privilege allows.

##### Project

Project user privileges vary depending on the type of user role assigned. Only users with the role of Administrator have the ability to create and modify user roles for other users.


#### e

##### CivicActions

All accounts issued for the admin management of Application or SSH access must be approved by the System Owner or Project Manager who must create an account request. The CivicActions Operations staff applies appropriate account permissions and settings based on the job role and function documented within the request ticket using processes defined by the CivicActions' Security Office.

##### Project

The System Owner approves, and CivicActions Operations set up the initial Administrator account for Project. Subsequent client access and related approvals are managed by CivicActions Operations in collaboration with the System Owner.


#### f

##### CivicActions

CivicActions Operations staff is responsible for the following account management activities for both internal administrative users and customer accounts:

- Establishing account justification
- Activating accounts
- Modifying accounts
- Expiring accounts
- Disabling accounts
- Removing accounts


#### g

##### AWS

In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail and Amazon S3 Bucket logging are enabled, which provide the audit trail capability for the organization to monitor the use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts. An Amazon S3 bucket centrally contains the CloudTrail audit logs. Amazon CloudWatch Alarm is configured to send an alert when any of the following happen:
  - an API call is made to create, update, or delete a Network ACL/Security Group
  - AWS account *root user* activity is detected
  - multiple API actions or login attempts fail
  - IAM Configuration changes are detected
  - new IAM access key was created
  - changes to the CloudTrail log configuration are detected


##### CivicActions

All CivicActions systems log the usage of information accounts.

##### Drupal

Drupal monitors the usage of information accounts in the Watchdog log.

##### Ilias

Ilias monitors the usage of information accounts in a log on the server.

#### h

##### CivicActions

In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC-01) Policy when an account is no longer required, the Project Manager notifies the Operations Team to immediately disable all access. Users upon reassignment, change in roles, termination, or leaving employment are initially removed from all roles and groups, effectively denying them all access to privileged accounts.


#### i

##### CivicActions

System accounts require access authorizations prior to accounts being created. The Project Manager must initiate an access request for an account to be created. CivicActions Operations staff reviews the request to ensure accuracy, including intended system usage and other attributes of the user access being requested.


##### Project

Project governs their own administrative access. Users with
the Administrator roles are empowered to designate and approve
Administrators.


#### j

##### CivicActions

All privileged accounts are reviewed by CivicActions Operations staff every 180 days.


##### Project

Administrators are empowered to and responsible for reviewing their own accounts and determining whether the accounts should still be authorized.


#### k

##### CivicActions

In accordance with standard security best practices and CivicActions policy, shared and reissued accounts for internal accounts of any kind are not created nor used for any purpose in any system.


### AC-3: Access Enforcement

```text
The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information           and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### AWS

In this architecture, AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Amazon S3 enforce access to the AWS infrastructure and data in Amazon S3 buckets. The baseline IAM groups and roles are associated with access policies to align user accounts with personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform management (e.g. Billing, Amazon EC2/VPC/Amazon RDS systems administration, I.T. auditing, etc.) Login/API access is restricted to those users for whom the organization has authorized and created, or federated, IAM user accounts, and assigned the appropriate IAM group and/or role memberships. Amazon S3 buckets have specific access control policies assigned to restrict access to those IAM users who are assigned the appropriate IAM roles/groups.


##### Drupal

Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via a unique username/password for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.
The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.


##### Ilias

Access control in Ilias is enforced by authentication via Shibboleth single sing on (SSO) for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.
The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Project Administrators, HR Managers, and Org Managers are the only roles that can create new user accounts.


##### Project

The The Project ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted in Section 1.1.1 of the Project SSP. The technical support staff ensures that access to security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each instance. Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless explicitly permitted.


### AC-6: Least Privilege

```text
The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.
```

##### SSH

SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are reported and reviewed by the Security Office and evaluated to determine roles that need to be revoked.

### AC-7: Unsuccessful Logon Attempts

```text
The information system:
  a.  Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive
invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
  b.  Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined
time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
```

**Status:** Complete

##### Project

The Project system locks out users after three unsuccessful login attempts. The information system automatically locks the account permanently, unless an administrator unlocks the account before then, when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts (3) is exceeded.


#### a

##### Drupal

Drupal can be configured to lock an account after a specified number of invalid login attempts within a specified time period. The default for Drupal is 5 failed login attempts within six hours.

#### b

##### Drupal

Lockdown following unsuccessful attempts is configurable by Drupal administrators to conform to defined requirements. When a user exceeds the limit of invalid login attempts, their account is automatically locked for a specified time and requires administrator action to unlock the account before the lockout period expires.

### AC-8: System Use Notification

```text
The information system:
  a.  Displays to users [Assignment: organization-defined system use notification
message or banner] before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and states that:
    1.  Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system;
    2.  Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
    3.  Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to
criminal and civil penalties; and
    4.  Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;
  b.  Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge
the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system; and
  c.  For publicly accessible systems:
    1.  Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined conditions],
before granting further access;
    2.  Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that
are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
    3.  Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.
```

**Status:** Partial

##### Ilias

System Use Notification is inherited from the Project.

##### Project

A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system know that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution. The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable by fines or imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use notification message before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification banner will remain on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to log on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on all system instances:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

- The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
- At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
- Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
- This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or privacy.
- Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."


### AC-14: Permitted Actions Without Identification Or Authentication

##### AWS

Hardware Baselines

All hardware is maintained by the AWS cloud. The system inherits hardware configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to AWS, dated 1 May 2013, for the following: baseline configuration.


##### CivicActions

A current baseline configuration is always available - stored as a tag in the Git repository - such that the site can be regenerated or rolled back should unauthorized or failing changes be applied.


##### Ilias

The baseline configuration is maintained in Git and described in the Configuration Management Plan, which describes the change workflow and software configuration. In the context of Security Configuration Management, the baseline configuration is a collection of formally approved configuration state(s) of one or more configuration items ("features") that compose the system. The baseline configuration is used to restore and serves as the basis against which the next change or set of changes to the system is made.
The features for the system are maintained in the website's source code, which is managed in Git, a source code version control system. Once the source code is updated, Git maintains the new version of staged code once committed in the Git repository as the new baseline. All code prior to it being staged is documented, tested and approved by CivicActions Development, which is described in control SA-3. The production environment is configured to take database snapshots daily.


##### Project

A CM process has been established and documented in the Project CMP. All updates are made in accordance with the procedures outlined in the CMP. The CM process establishes a baseline of hardware, software, firmware and documentation, as well as changes thereto, throughout the development and life cycle of the information system. CM ensures the control of the information system through its life cycle. It assures that additions, deletions, or changes made to the Project system do not unintentionally or unknowingly diminish security.

##### AWS

In this architecture, user data is limited to that which is stored in the Amazon RDS database. Amazon RDS is fully backed up by a daily snapshot as well as through transaction logging conducted by AWS as part of this managed service. Full database recovery from snapshot or point-in-time can be initiated from the Amazon RDS console/API.


##### CivicActions

CivicActions conducts system user-level information backup in accordance with requirements (at a minimum, incremental backups must be conducted at least weekly and full backups must be conducted at least monthly).


#### b

##### AWS

AWS built-in features automatically backs up system-level information limited to infrastructure CONFIGURATION information within the AWS account. While individual running Amazon EC2 instances and attached EBS volumes are NOT backed up, they can be reconstituted from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) provided by AWS (which are backed up by AWS) and user data scripts included in CloudFormation templates. Once deployed, the CloudFormation template contents are backed up by AWS R488within the CloudFormation service. These AWS backups of AWS services are transparent to the customer as part of AWS backend processes.


##### CivicActions

System-level information for the application is replicated and backed up in the same way as user-level information as defined in CP-9(a).


#### c

##### AWS

AWS built-in features back up online administrator and developer documentation, limited to that which is published at https://aws.amazon.com/documentation.


##### CivicActions

##### Project

Project is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts, which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the website's software configuration, as described in IA-5(d).

In accordance with Project site configuration, the following administrative procedures exist for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.

- Initial authenticator distribution: Users receive a one-time login link
  by email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log
  in and then must enter a password themselves which complies with the
  password complexity requirements described in IA-4(b).

- Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators: Users who have forgotten their
  password may request a new password by submitting their username or
  email address. The website responds by emailing a one-time login link
  to the user's email address. After using the link to log in, the user
  is required to enter a new password.

- Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in
  the last 90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators may block
  any user account if they believe there is a reason to do so.


#### e

##### Drupal

Drupal requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the application website enforces this. Each user account is assigned a default password that is randomly generated, not possible to guess, and not shared with anyone, including site administrators. When the user logs in and creates a new password, the default password is erased from the website database.


##### Ilias

Ilias requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the application website enforces this.

##### Project

Project position sensitivity levels are assigned by the The Client. Each position designation is documented on the Standard Position Description (SPD) and assigned a risk level (or sensitivity level) commensurate with the sensitivity of the information, the risk to that information and the system maintaining that information. The levels of risk still need to be designated by Client for employee and contractor positions but since Project system does not have any sensitive data, a low risk scenario can be assumed.

- Employee risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= LBI, High Risk= BI.
- Contractor risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= NACC, High Risk= BI.

In order to ensure every employee is assigned to a position, which has been reviewed for sensitivity by the NCC, the SPD is a required data attribute of an employee’s HR record. Position risks designations are reviewed and revised when NCC or OPM publish changes to sensitivity levels.

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog

Information system access is terminated immediately upon the voluntary or involuntary departure of an employee. In the case of involuntary departure, in addition to immediate termination of system access, at no point is a departing employee allowed access to any part of the CivicActions infrastructure.
In the case of voluntary departure, employees are permitted access to the information system for the duration of their offboarding period. The departing employee’s manager is responsible for informing the Information Technology department when the employee offboarding period concludes. At this time system and facility, access is terminated.


#### b

##### CivicActions

The terminated user’s accounts are disabled and all access associated with the individual is revoked.


#### c

##### CivicActions

The employee's manager or the Office of Human Resources conducts exit interviews with all employees who leave CivicActions voluntarily. There is a general discussion about the process of turning in any/all company-issued devices, laptops, etc.


#### d

##### CivicActions

CivicActions employees provide their own equipment that must be hardened to security requirements depending upon their roles and duties. CivicActions supplies two-factor authentication tokens that become the property of the employee.
Some employees may receive company-issued hardware for working on particular projects. These items are collected before the employee exits CivicActions. In the case of an involuntary termination, the Office of Human Resources works to collect company-issued devices and provides paperwork highlighting confidential protections for customers.


#### e

##### CivicActions

Access to CivicActions information and information systems is always shared so that the termination of an individual will not prevent CivicActions from having access to needed resources.


#### f

##### CivicActions

When a person is terminated, a standard off-boarding process is used to notify management and CivicActions' Operations staff, and to track the process of disabling access to the information system/information system components. The CivicActions Operations staff and Security Office are given at least four hours notice to schedule the deactivation of access upon termination. Deactivation is a manual process that is tracked via a Trello card in order to meet the four hour turnaround time before termination.

##### Project

The Project draws from the None, NIST SP 800-64, and Agile software development methodology to ensure security requirements are incorporated during each phase of the life cycle. This helps to ensure the development of secure systems and effective risk management.


#### a

##### CivicActions

The system and application(s) are managed by CivicActions using the Agile software development methodology, which provides a continuous System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology. CivicActions Agile management continues to improve the software through ongoing planned code releases. The process is overseen by the Change Control Board (CCB) as described in CM-1. Each point release introduces code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:

- Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request project of the CivicActions ticketing system which describes the overall goals of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in the ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release. Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades to newer versions of the software packages that have been used to build the website.
- Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks. Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which the CCB selects a list of tickets to be implemented. CivicActions Development holds daily coordination meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which issues have been resolved and which need further work.
- Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate code branch within the CivicActions Git repository, and tested using the GitLab Runner continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on a ticket is completed, the developer creates a merge request, and the changes are submitted to at least one other developer for review to ensure they meet functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull request is merged into the Git repository's development branch for the planned code release.
- Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and configuration necessary to implement the changes are merged into the website's staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.
- User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release notes to be shared with the customer.
- Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production and presented to CivicActions' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.
- Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately prior to the deployment.
- Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a security scan using a web vulnerability scanner.

  Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from a variety of sources:

- Customer support requests received by the CivicActions Help Desk
- Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by users
- Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis of those incidents performed by the CivicActions Security Office and Operations staff
- Security notifications received by the CivicActions Security Office from external security teams and other software vendors
- Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by the CivicActions Security Office
- Issues reported by the CivicActions Security Office, Operations staff and Development
- Security issues reported through continuous monitoring
