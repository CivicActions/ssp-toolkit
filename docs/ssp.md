# ACCESS CONTROL

## AC-01 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-1>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

Access control policy and procedures are documented in the LINCS SSP. Access to LINCS Technology Project operational information or system resources is limited to only authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access control policies to protect the integrity of the LINCS Technology Project system. This Department reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated, as necessary, since April 2008.

Additional information is contained within the Department of Education, OCIO-01, Handbook for Information Assurance Cybersecurity Policy.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Access Control (AC) Policy.  This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud Service Providers dated 1 May 2013.



## AC-02 ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Partially Inheritable


#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: AWS account management.



### Part a)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.

Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain areas of the LINCS Technology Project system. User access is controlled by the completion and submission of LINCS Technology Project System Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial account is created. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support contractor review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from the system by the system administrator.

The LINCS Technology Project has implemented user account procedures to disable inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The LINCS support staff monitors all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication Management, of the LINCS SSP illustrates the exact procedures the contractor support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

The LINCS Technology Project system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions Operations, in collaboration with CivicActions Security, will set up privileged accounts accounts for the following roles:

* Developer - user level account that has access to application features and sanitized databases

* System Administrator - user accounts that enjoy full system administrator access



#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal provides user accounts for individuals who participate in visiting, contributing to and administering the site with the following roles:

* Anonymous user – readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not logged in.

* Authenticated user – All non-anonymous users inherit the "authenticated user role."

* Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.



### Part b)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The Project Owner has oversight over all permissions that the Project Manager and Operations Staff manages.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions' Project Manager assigns the "admininstrator" role for the management of all accounts issued to internal admin roles supporting the information system. Account requests are initiated by the Project Manager by completing a ticket request and the CivicActions Operation Team manages the entire account creation process.



### Part c)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

In accordance with LINCS Access Control Policy, LINCS group membership is determined according to the individual's position and role within the organization. A ticket request is used to request accounts and group membership. The request is authorized by the appropriate manager.



### Part d)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS user privileges vary depending on the type of user role assigned. Only users with the role of Site Manager have the ability to create and modify user roles for other users.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

All accounts issued for application administrators and SSH are documented in CivicActions' ticketing system. Account request tickets contain details that explain the attributes for the account including authorized users of Drupal, system infrastructure, group and role membership, and access authorizations.



#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal has a sophisticated permissions and role-based access control built in. Each role within Drupal can only access the documents and controls for which their privilege allows.



### Part e)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

CivicActions sets up the initial Site Manager account for LINCS; however, any subsequent client access and related approvals are managed by LINCS.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

All accounts issued for the admin management of Application or SSH access must be approved by the Project Owner or Project Manager who must create an account request. The CivicActions Operations Team applies appropriate account permissions and settings based on the job role and function documented within the request ticket using processes defined by the CivicActions Security Team.



### Part f)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions Operations is responsible for the following account management activities for both internal administrative users and customer accounts:

* Establishing account justification

* Activating accounts

* Modifying accounts

* Expiring accounts

* Disabling accounts

* Removing accounts



### Part g)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All CivicActions systems log the usage of information accounts.



#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal monitors the usage of information accounts in the watchdog.log.



### Part h)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC-01) Policy when an account is no longer required, the Project Manager notifies the Operations Team to immediately disable all access. Users upon reassignment, change in roles, termination, or leaving employment are initially removed from all roles and groups, effectively denying them all access to privileged accounts.



### Part i)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS governs their own administrative access. The designated government contracting official responsible for approving the purchase of CivicActions' services, or authorized representative, is empowered to designate and approve Site Managers. It is left to the discretion of the designated government contracting official or authorized representative to determine if a Site Manager is considered to have a valid reason for accessing the CC application.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

System accounts require access authorizations prior to accounts being created. The Project Manager must initiate an access request for an account to be created. CivicActions Operations reviews the request to ensure accuracy, including intended system usage and other attributes of the user access being requested.



### Part j)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Site Managers are empowered to and responsible for reviewing their own accounts and determining whether the accounts should still be authorized.



#### CivicActions Responsibility

All privileged accounts are reviewed by CivicActions Operations every 180 days.



### Part k)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with standard security best practices and CivicActions policy, shared and reissued accounts for internal accounts of any kind are not created nor used for any purpose in any system.



## AC-03 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-3>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The LINCS Technology Project ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted in Section 1.1.1 of the LINCS SSP. The technical support staff ensures that access to security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each instance. Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless explicitly permitted.



#### Drupal specific control support

Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via unique username/password for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions and access are provided on "least privilege" principle.

The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: AWS account management.



## AC-06 LEAST PRIVILEGE

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-6>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Drupal privileged access roles are designated by LINCS which is responsible for determining who will have administrator privileges and the ability to create other user accounts, including user accounts with the role of "administrator".



#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions performs regular audits of privileged users as part of the practice of enforcing least privilege.



#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions implements the policy of least privilege for all logical components of Drupal by allowing only authorized access for users, which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need.

At the application layer, Drupal is designed with a role based user access system, a least privileged approach based on assignment of privileges to roles. Drupal‘s permission systems enables control of what users can do and see on the site. CivicActions has defined a specific set of permissions for each of the user roles mentioned in control AC-5.

SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are reported and reviewed by the CivicActions Data team and evaluated to determine roles that need to be revoked.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: application of least privilege.



## AC-06 (9) AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-6>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions, at least quarterly, audits all team accounts based on the concept of least privilege. Each member of the developer team is assigned a role of which defines access needed to perform only the member’s job function.  The audit of accounts is reported and reviewed by the CivicActions Operations and evaluated to determine whether roles or membership within the developer team should be changed.



## AC-07 UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-7>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The LINCS Technology Project system locks out users after three unsuccessful login attempts. The information system automatically locks the account permanently, unless an administrator unlocks the account before then, when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts (3) is exceeded.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: unsuccessful logon attempts.



### Part a)

#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal can be configured to lock an account after a specified number of invalid login attempts within specified time period.



### Part b)

#### Drupal specific control support

Lock down following unsuccessful attempts is configurable by Drupal administrators to conform to defined requirements.  When a user exceeds the limit of invalid logon attempts, their account is automatically locked for a specfied time and requires administrator action to unlock the account before the lockout period expires.



## AC-08 SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-8>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system know that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution. The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable by fines or imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use notification message before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification banner will remain on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to log on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on all Department instances:

"You are accessing a U.S. Federal Government computer system intended to be solely accessed by individual users expressly authorized to access the system by the U.S. Department of Education. Usage may be monitored, recorded, and/or subject to audit. For security purposes and in order to ensure that the system remains available to all expressly authorized users, the U.S. Department of Education monitors the system to identify unauthorized users. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and recording. Unauthorized use of this information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties. Except as expressly authorized by the U.S. Department of Education, unauthorized attempts to access, obtain, upload, modify, change, and/or delete information on this system are strictly prohibited and are subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C § 1030, and other applicable statutes, which may result in fines and imprisonment. For purposes of this system, unauthorized access includes, but is not limited to:

* Any access by an employee or agent of a commercial entity, or other third party, who is not the individual user, for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain (regardless of whether the commercial entity or third party is providing a service to an authorized user of the system); and

* Any access in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State.

If system monitoring reveals information indicating possible criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to law enforcement personnel."

## CM-02 BASELINE CONFIGURATION

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

A CM process has been established and documented in the LINCS Technology Project CMP. All updates are made in accordance with the procedures outlined in the CMP.  The CM process establishes a baseline of hardware, software, firmware and documentation, as well as changes thereto, throughout the development and life cycle of the information system. CM ensures the control of the information system through its life cycle. It assures that additions, deletions, or changes made to the LINCS Technology Project system do not unintentionally or unknowingly diminish security. If the change is major, the security of the system must be re-analyzed.



#### Drupal specific control support

The baseline configuration is maintained in Git and described in the Configuration Management Plan, which describes the change workflow and software configuration. In the context of Security Configuration Management, the baseline configuration is a collection of formally approved configuration state(s) of one or more configuration items ("features") that compose the system. The baseline configuration is used to restore and serves as the basis against which the next change or set of changes to the system is made.

The features for the system are maintained in the website's source code, which is managed in git, a source code version control system. Once the source code is updated, git maintains the new version of staged code once committed in the git repository as the new baseline. All code prior to it being staged is documented, tested and approved by CivicActions Development, which is described in control SA-3. The production environment is configured to take database snapshots daily.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system inherits server configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration for IaaS components.

Hardware Baselines

All hardware is maintained by AWS Cloud. The system therefore inherits hardware configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration.

Server Configuration

AWS maintains the baseline software configuration for the server components required to run the Drupal platform upon which the system is built.

> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal configuration settings use automated mechanisms to automate code deployment and baseline settings changes. The website's baseline configuration may be reapplied to the site at any time by manually retriggering a tagged code deployment.

The source code, which contains the site’s baseline configuration, is managed using git, a source code version control system. Git is used to track source code which allows administrators to easily deploy and roll back changes on production hosting environments.

The Features module is used to export configuration settings from the website's MySQL database and stores them as code so that the configuration settings can be managed within the git source code version control system.



## CM-02 (3) RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>

> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: identifier management.



### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

Access to the system is authorized by the Product Owner or Project Manager for each role as described in AC-2.



#### Drupal specific control support

Upon account creation, the Drupal software assigns each user account a unique numerical user ID (uid). This uid is used internally by the system to track user actions such as content creation or editing. The numerical user IDs are never reused even if their user accounts are subsequently blocked or deleted.



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

User accounts are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a unique username, password and email address based on the system for allocating user accounts described in AC-2.

In accordance with CivicActions Identification and Authentication (IA) Policy <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/blob/master/IA-Policy.md>, CivicActions internal users are uniquely identified by creation of an organizational account with a username based on each user's first and last names.



#### Drupal specific control support

When Drupal user accounts are created, users' email addresses are verified by sending a single-use activation link to the user’s mailbox. The email recipient then uses the activation link to log in to the website and supply a password which must meet the system's password complexity requirements.



### Part c)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

User accounts are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a unique username, password and email address based on the system for allocating user accounts described in AC-2.



#### Drupal specific control support

Identifiers for CivicActions internal personnel include a username based on the individual's full first and last name and are reviewed for uniqueness by the admin group when it approves creation of the user account.



### Part d)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

Account usernames may not be re-used for at least two years.



#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal users unique identifier (the numeric user id, or uid) is never reused.



### Part e)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

All user accounts are required to change their passwords every 90 days. The website will automatically block the accounts of users who fail to change their password within that time period, after which the account may only be unblocked by a website Administrator or CivicActions Operations.



## IA-05 AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: authenticator management.



### Part a)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Authentication for LINCS internal personnel are created during the personnel assignment process where requests are made to the LINCS admin group for proper access levels. The LINCS admin group verifies the identity of the user. The website performs further verification by sending an email to the user's mailbox containing a single-use activation link which must be used to log in to the account for the first time and to create a password.



#### Drupal specific control support

Refer to control AC-2 in this SSP for further details on account provisioning.

CivicActions will create and maintain an initial Drupal Administrator (highest level of Drupal Account). New Administrators are able to provide additional Administrator access at their own discretion, and are ultimately responsible for managing their own Administrator and other user accounts that they create.



### Part b)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS admins in collaboration with CivicActions Operations are responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts in compliance with the authentication requirements described herein.



#### Drupal specific control support

Initial authenticator content (a unique email address – not previously used in any other account) is provided by the user. Internal initial password requirements set by CivicActions Operations and ongoing password refreshes by internal user follow the requirements set in the Identification and Authentication Policy.



### Part c)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

When entering a user account password upon initial login to lincs.ed.gov, all users must comply with the following password policies, which are enforced by the website's software configuration:

* Password must be at least 14 characters in length.

* Password must contain at least one digit.

* Password must contain at least one special character (not whitespace or an alphanumeric).

* Password must contain at least one uppercase character.

* Password must contain at least one lowercase character.



#### Drupal specific control support

The system partially inherits this control from Drupal standard password strength mechanisms.



### Part d)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts, which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the website's software configuration, as described in IA-5(d).

In accordance with LINCS site configuration, the following administrative procedures exist for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.

* Initial authenticator distribution: Users receive a one-time login link by email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log in and then must enter a password themselves which complies with the password complexity requirements described in IA-4(b).

* Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators: Users who have forgotten their password may request a new password by submitting their username or email address. The website responds by emailing a one-time login link to the user's email address. After using the link to log in, the user is required to enter a new password.

* Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in the last 90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators and Site Managers may block any user account if they believe there is a reason to do so.



#### Drupal specific control support

The system partially inherits this control from Drupal standard password management.

All password creation/change/reset operations are recorded in the website's "Drupal watchdog" logs.



### Part e)

#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the application website enforces this. User accounts are assigned a randomly-generated and unguessable default password that is not shared with anyone, including site Administrators. Once the user logs in and creates a new password, the default password erased from the website's database.



### Part f)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS authenticators follow these password lifetime restrictions:

* Maximum password age = 90

* Minimum password age = 1

* Password reuse restriction = 10



### Part g)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS enforces password lifetime restrictions.  The password lifetime settings for internal accounts is as follows:

* Minimum restriction of zero (1) days and

* Maximum restriction of ninety (90) days before a password change is required.



### Part h)

#### Drupal specific control support

For all Drupal users, passwords are protected by the website's software, which only stores an encrypted string based on the password. This means that even if the website's database should be compromised, an attacker would still be unable to know users' actual passwords. Internal users receive training in security awareness and acceptable use and are instructed never to reveal their passwords to anyone.



### Part i)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions users are required to take appropriate measures in the handling of passwords including:

* Not transmitting user names and passwords together in an unencrypted format

* Not permitting the sending of passwords in an unencrypted format via email

* Not listing passwords in tickets

* Not writing down or storing passwords in a readable form in any physical or logical location where they may be discoverable by unauthorized persons.



#### Drupal specific control support

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: password based authentication.



### Part a)

#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal supports the requirement for password based authentication complexity. New users of Drupal are required to specify their password authentication as soon as they log in to the website for the first.  The website requires all submitted passwords to comply with validation rules, as described above in IA-5(c).

Changing password lifetime, length, reuse or strength requirements requires a code setting change that therefore needs to be planned and approved by CivicActions' Change Control Board before being implemented.



### Part b)

#### Drupal specific control support

When required to change passwords, Drupal users are required to change their authenticator password by changing at least one character. Enforcement of this control is implemented through the website's software configuration.



### Part c)

#### Drupal specific control support

All Drupal passwords are encrypted in storage, using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm with a salt. The hash function is performed repeatedly to further obfuscate the password via key stretching. In transmission, passwords are encrypted using SSL via HTTPS.



### Part d)

#### Drupal specific control support

The website requires all submitted passwords to comply with lifetime rules, as described above in IA-5(g).



### Part e)

#### Drupal specific control support

Password reuse is limited through software configuration.



### Part f)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The LINCS Technology Project’s position sensitivity levels are assigned by the Department of Education and National Classification Center (NCC) as part of the position designation required by OPM under 5 CFR 731.106. Each Department position designation is documented on the Standard Position Description (SPD) and assigned a risk level (or sensitivity level) commensurate with the sensitivity of the information, the risk to that information and the system maintaining that information. The levels of risk still need to be designated by the Department for employee and contractor positions but since the LINCS Technology Project system does not have any sensitive data, a low risk scenario can be assumed.

* Employee risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= LBI, High Risk= BI.

* Contractor risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= NACC, High Risk= BI.

In order to ensure every employee is assigned to a position, which has been reviewed for sensitivity by the NCC, the SPD is a required data attribute of an employee’s HR record. Position risks designations are reviewed and revised when NCC or OPM publish changes to sensitivity levels.

This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: system development life cycle.



### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

The system and application(s) are managed by CivicActions using the Agile software development methodology, which provides a continuous System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology. CivicActions' Agile management continues to improve the software through ongoing planned code releases. Each point release introduces code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:

* Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request project of CivicActions' ticketing system which describes the overall goals of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in CivicActions' Github ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release. Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades to newer versions of the software packages that have been used to build the website.

Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from a variety of sources:

* Customer support requests received by the CivicActions Help Desk

* Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by users

* Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis of those incidents performed by CivicActions Security and Operations

* Security notifications received by CivicActions Security from external security teams and other software vendors

* Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by CivicActions Security

* Issues reported by CivicActions Security, Operations and Development

* Security issues reported through continuous monitoring

* Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks.  Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which CivicActions developers select a list of tickets to be implemented. The developer team holds daily coordination meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which issues have been resolved and which need further work.

* Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate code branch within the CivicActions git repository for and tested using the CircleCI continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on a ticket is completed, the developer creates a pull request, and the changes are submitted to at least one other developer for review to ensure they meet functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull request is merged into the git repository's development branch for the planned code release.

* Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and configuration necessary to implement the changes is merged into the website's staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.

* User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release notes to be shared with the customer.

* Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production and presented to CivicActions' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.

* Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately prior to the deployment.

* Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a security scan using the a web vulnerability scanner.



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

The CivicActions organization defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the SDLC. The following teams participate in this process:

* Customer Support: Files tickets when incidents are reported and shares incident reports with customers

* CivicActions Security: Receives security notifications from the Drupal security team and other software vendors; performs security scans; uses CivicActions JIRA and/or Git ticketing system to request mitigation of all reported vulnerabilities

* CivicActions Development: Performs server log analysis when security incidents are reported; assists in root cause analysis

* Change Control Board: Meets weekly to review and approve upcoming planned code changes to the website, include security-related code releases.

* AWS Cloud: Monitors server and application events; proactively responds to security incidents, and reports incidents to CivicActions

* Users: Communicates customer security requirements and expectations, and alerts CivicActions' customer support team whenever it detects a security or site performance issue

Security responsibilities performed by these teams include the following:

* Perform configuration management during information system design, development, implementation, and operation;

* Implement only organization-approved changes;

* Document approved changes;

* Manage and control changes to the system;
