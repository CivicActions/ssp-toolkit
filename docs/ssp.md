# ACCESS CONTROL

## AC-01 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-1>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel an access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Access Control (AC) Policy.  This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

Access control policy and procedures are documented in the LINCS SSP. Access to LINCS Technology Project operational information or system resources is limited to only authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access control policies to protect the integrity of the LINCS Technology Project system. This Department reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated, as necessary, since April 2008.

Additional information is contained within the Department of Education, OCIO-01, Handbook for Information Assurance Cybersecurity Policy.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud Service Providers dated 1 May 2013.



## AC-02 ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Partially Inheritable


#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: AWS account management.



### Part a)

#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal provides user accounts for individuals who participate in visiting, contributing to and administering the site with the following roles:

* Anonymous user – readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not logged in.

* Authenticated user – All non-anonymous users inherit the "authenticated user role."

* Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.

Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain areas of the LINCS Technology Project system. User access is controlled by the completion and submission of LINCS Technology Project System Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial account is created. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support contractor review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from the system by the system administrator.

The LINCS Technology Project has implemented user account procedures to disable inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The LINCS support staff monitors all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication Management, of the LINCS SSP illustrates the exact procedures the contractor support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

The LINCS Technology Project system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.



### Part b)

#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions' Project Manager assigns the "admininstrator" role for the management of all accounts issued to internal admin roles supporting the information system. Account requests are initiated by the Project Manager by completing a ticket request and the CivicActions Operation Team manages the entire account creation process.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The Project Owner has oversight over all permissions that the Project Manager and Operations Staff manages.



### Part c)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

In accordance with LINCS Access Control Policy, LINCS group membership is determined according to the individual's position and role within the organization. A ticket request is used to request accounts and group membership. The request is authorized by the appropriate manager.



### Part d)

#### Drupal specific control support

All accounts issued for Drupal administrators and SSH are documented in CivicActions' ticketing system. Account request tickets contain details that explain the attributes for the account including authorized users of Drupal, system infrastructure, group and role membership, and access authorizations.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS user privileges vary depending on the type of user role assigned. Only users with the role of Site Manager have the ability to create and modify user roles for other users.



### Part e)

#### Drupal specific control support

All accounts issued for the admin management of Drupal or SSH access must be approved by the Project Owner or Project Manager who must create an account request. The CivicActions Operations Team applies appropriate account permissions and settings based on the job role and function documented within the request ticket using processes defined by the CivicActions Security Team.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

CivicActions sets up the initial Site Manager account for LINCS; however, any subsequent client access and related approvals are managed by LINCS.



### Part f)

#### Drupal specific control support

The CivicActions Operations Team is responsible for the following account management activities for both internal administrative users and customer accounts:

* Establishing account justification

* Activating accounts

* Modifying accounts

* Expiring accounts

* Disabling accounts

* Removing accounts



### Part h)

#### Drupal specific control support

In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC) Policy when a CivicActions employee's account is no longer required, the employee’s manager notifies the Security Team to immediately disable all access. Users upon reassignment, change in roles, termination, or leaving employment are initially removed from all groups, effectively denying them all access to LINCS privileged accounts.



### Part i)

#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions Drupal administration accounts require access authorizations prior to accounts being created. Employee managers must initiate an access request for an account to be created. The CivicActions Operations Team reviews the request to ensure accuracy, including intended system usage and other attributes of the user access being requested.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS governs their own administrative access. The designated government contracting official responsible for approving the purchase of CivicActions' services, or authorized representative, is empowered to designate and approve Site Managers. It is left to the discretion of the designated government contracting official or authorized representative to determine if a Site Manager is considered to have a valid reason for accessing the CC application.



### Part j)

#### Drupal specific control support

All privileged accounts are reviewed by the CivicActions Operations Team every 180 days.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Site Managers are empowered to and responsible for reviewing their own accounts and determining whether the accounts should still be authorized.



### Part k)

#### Drupal specific control support

In accordance with standard security best practices and CivicActions policy, shared and reissued accounts for internal accounts of any kind are not created nor used for any purpose in any system.



## AC-03 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-3>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via unique username/password for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions and access are provided on "least privilege" principle.

The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Administrators and Site Managers are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The LINCS Technology Project ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted in Section 1.1.1 of the LINCS SSP. The technical support staff ensures that access to security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each instance. Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless explicitly permitted.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: AWS account management.



## AC-06 LEAST PRIVILEGE

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-6>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions performs regular audits of privileged users as part of the practice of enforcing least privilege.



#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions implements the policy of least privilege for all logical components of Drupal by allowing only authorized access for users, which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational need.

At the application layer, Drupal is designed with a role based user access system, a least privileged approach based on assignment of privileges to roles. Drupal‘s permission systems enables control of what users can do and see on the site. In consultation with LINCS, CivicActions has defined a specific set of permissions for each of the user roles mentioned in control AC-5.

SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are reported and reviewed by the CivicActions Data team and evaluated to determine roles that need to be revoked.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Drupal privileged access roles are designated by LINCS which is responsible for determining who will have administrator privileges and the ability to create other user accounts, including user accounts with the role of "administrator".



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: application of least privilege.



## AC-06 (9) AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-6>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions, at least quarterly, audits all team accounts based on the concept of least privilege. Each member of the developer team is assigned a role of which defines access needed to perform only the member’s job function.  The audit of accounts is reported and reviewed by the LINCS admin group and evaluated to determine whether roles or membership within the developer team should be changed. 



## AC-07 UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-7>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The LINCS Technology Project system locks out users after three unsuccessful login attempts. The information system automatically locks the account permanently, unless an administrator unlocks the account before then, when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts (3) is exceeded.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: unsuccessful logon attempts.



### Part a)

#### Drupal specific control support

Drupal can be configured to lock an account after a specified number of invalid login attempts within specified time period.



### Part b)

#### Drupal specific control support

Lock down following unsuccessful attempts is configurable by Drupal administrators to conform to defined requirements.  When a user exceeds the limit of invalid logon attempts, their account is automatically locked for a specfied time and requires administrator action to unlock the account before the lockout period expires.



## AC-08 SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=AC-8>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system know that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution. The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable by fines or imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use notification message before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification banner will remain on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to log on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on all Department instances:

"You are accessing a U.S. Federal Government computer system intended to be solely accessed by individual users expressly authorized to access the system by the U.S. Department of Education. Usage may be monitored, recorded, and/or subject to audit. For security purposes and in order to ensure that the system remains available to all expressly authorized users, the U.S. Department of Education monitors the system to identify unauthorized users. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and recording. Unauthorized use of this information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties. Except as expressly authorized by the U.S. Department of Education, unauthorized attempts to access, obtain, upload, modify, change, and/or delete information on this system are strictly prohibited and are subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C § 1030, and other applicable statutes, which may result in fines and imprisonment. For purposes of this system, unauthorized access includes, but is not limited to:

* Any access by an employee or agent of a commercial entity, or other third party, who is not the individual user, for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain (regardless of whether the commercial entity or third party is providing a service to an authorized user of the system); and

* Any access in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State.

If system monitoring reveals information indicating possible criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to law enforcement personnel."

### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

CivicActions' Security Policy provides information about auditing and logging of CivicActions internal users and end-user activity on the servers and within the system application.



#### Drupal specific control support

Transaction logs are generated by the Apache web server, Drupal CMS, MySQL database and PHP page processing.  Specifically, the following server, application, database and network device audit log events are captured:

* Apache access log :: Contains a list of requests for your website that have bypassed Varnish. These requests include pages, theme files, and static media files.

* Apache error log :: Records any Apache-level issues. The issues reported here are usually caused by general server issues, including capacity problems, .htaccess problems, and missing files.

* Drupal page request log :: Records all Drupal page loads on your website.

* Drupal watchdog log :: Records Drupal-related actions on your website. The watchdog log is recorded on your server if you have enabled the syslog module.

* MySQL slow query log :: Contains a list of MySQL queries that have taken longer than one second to complete.

* PHP error log :: Records any issues that occur during the PHP processing portion of a page load. Issues reported here are usually caused by a website’s code, configuration, or content.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

Transaction logs are generated by the AWS Cloud, so this system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following:  audit events for the AWS platform. Specifically, AWS is responsible for logging the following server, application, database and network device audit log events:

* Apache access log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* Apache error log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* Drupal page request log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* Drupal watchdog log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* PHP error log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

* MySQL slow query log :: Since slow query logs are stored in a root-only MySQL directory on your servers, you can only download them using the Cloud > Logs page, and you cannot access them directly on the server. For more information, see Downloading your slow query log and Tools for parsing a slow query log.

* Varnish log :: Notes which requests have been served by Varnish cache and which were not. Since most customers use shared load balancers, Varnish logs are only available via the Log Streaming feature and cannot be downloaded from either the Insight website or your servers.



### Part b)

## CM-02 BASELINE CONFIGURATION

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The application software component of lincs.ed.gov consists of (1) the DKAN distribution of the Drupal web application platform, with (2) additional software features that were developed expressly for lincs.ed.gov based on specifications provided by LINCS.

Baseline configuration for the website's standard DKAN features is stored in the website's codebase and managed using the Features module for Drupal (<https://www.drupal.org/project/features>). Site administrators can view the list of features by visiting the site's features management page at https://www.lincs.ed.gov/admin/structure/features. Most of the configuration for additional features that were developed specifically for lincs.ed.gov is also managed using the Drupal Features module.

The Features module makes it possible to override configuration for individual features without modifying the codebase. It stores those overridden features in the website's MySQL database. The features management page referenced above shows which components of each feature are based on the default configuration stored in code, and shows which components have been overridden in the database. Most components of lincs.ed.gov are based on the default configuration stored in code, but there are approximately a dozen components that have overrides stored in the database.

CivicActions maintains documentation describing each custom feature for lincs.ed.gov that is not standard DKAN, as well as documentation describing feature components that have overrides stored in the database.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The baseline configuration is described in Section 3.2 of the Configuration Management Plan, which describes the approved configuration of the LINCS system including all of its hardware, software, and firmware components and the physical and logical locations of each. In the context of Security Configuration Management, the baseline configuration is a collection of formally approved configuration state(s) of one or more configuration items ("features") that compose the LINCS system. The baseline configuration is used by LINCS to restore and serves as the basis against which the next change or set of changes to the LINCS is made.

The features for the LINCS system are maintained in the website's source code, which is managed in git, a source code version control system. Once the source code is updated, git maintains the new version of staged code once committed in the git repository as the new baseline. All code prior to it being staged is documented, tested and approved by CivicActions' DKAN Engineering team, which is described in control SA-3. The LINCS production environment is configured to take database snapshots daily.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system therefore inherits server configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration for IaaS components.

Hardware Baselines

All hardware is maintained by AWS Cloud. The system therefore inherits hardware configuration aspects of this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: baseline configuration.

Server Configuration

AWS maintains the baseline software configuration for the server components required to run the Drupal platform upon which the system is built.

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS configuration settings use automated mechanisms to automate code deployment and baseline settings changes. The website's baseline configuration may be reapplied to the site at any time by manually retriggering a code deployment using the AWS dashboard.

The source code, which contains the site’s baseline configuration, is managed using git, a source code version control system. Git is used to track source code which allows administrators to easily deploy and roll back changes on production hosting environments.

The Features module (described above under "Application Configuration") is used to export configuration settings from the website's MySQL database and stores them as code so that the configuration settings can be managed within the git source code version control system.



## CM-02 (3) RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS

> Control description: <http://800-53.govready.com/control?id=CM-2>
> 
> 
> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


#### CivicActions Responsibility

Previous baseline configurations are retained in git, which implements unlimited revision control. Each version of the codebase is given a unique tag when it is deployed to production. When new features are ready for deployment to production, the new code release is given a new tag. This makes it possible to roll back to a previous version of the baseline configuration if needed by redeploying the older release tag.

### Part a)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the Configuration Management Plan and control SA-3, CivicActions releases changes to the baseline configuration of the application through planned point releases, which bundle multiple new features, and feature changes into a single planned code releases. Point releases occur roughly every two months. Since they bundle multiple new features into a single release, Examples of the types of changes that may be introduced through a code release include the following, ordered by increasing level of possible security risk:

1. Minor application code changes

2. New software releases for Drupal core, contributed Drupal modules, or other software components that are supplied by outside open source vendors

3. Significant software enhancement

4. Major application modification



### Part b)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

In accordance with the Configuration Management Plan, CivicActions performs security impact analysis of all planned code releases. Level of impact is assessed by the Engineering team before the planned code release is presented to the Change Control Board (CCB) for final approval. Significant software enhancements and major application modifications require approval from the Tech Lead of the Engineering team. Once a code release is considered ready for deployment, a CCB Review is done before scheduling deployment of the code release to production, in accordance with the Agile-based System Development Life Cycle methodology described



### Part c)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

Configuration changes follow the CivicActions CCB process. The changes themselves are documented clearly within a Change Request (CR) ticket in the CivicActions (JIRA or Git) ticketing system. The CR ticket has an approval step built into the ticketing workflow that is required before the implementation phase. The CCB is responsible for reviewing the change and either approving (all members of the CCB must come to a consensus) or rejecting the proposal. These workflow changes are captured within an audit log in the ticket, and are available to anyone viewing the ticket.



### Part d)

#### CivicActions Responsibility

See part b). Configuration changes are captured within tickets in the CivicActions ticketing system. Each CR follows a specific workflow within the ticketing system that follows our process:

#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions users of the system are required to identify and authenticate in order to access any functions of the information system beyond viewing and downloading the publicly available website content that is available to all anonymous website visitors. Users who are assigned to CivicActions require the appropriate authorization described in AC-2. CivicActions users authenticate using the standard Drupal login protocol prior to using the LINCS services. LINCS user roles are described in AC-3.

To access the website as an authenticated user, front-end users of the application must first request and be given a login account with a unique username, password and email address. Login accounts can only be created by existing website users with the role of either Administrator or Site Manager. Users with those roles also assign roles to each login account that govern the user's ability to create, publish, update or delete website content such as blog entries, datasets and data resource files.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS Access: Site Managers and End Users

* Site Manager access to web-accessible components of lincs.ed.gov is limited. Full access to web-accessible components is only available to CivicActions administrators.

* End Users, typically members of the public, have read-only access to view and download data resources published on lincs.ed.gov and do not need or receive user accounts.

> Security control type: Hybrid


### Part a)

#### Drupal specific control support

Upon account creation, the Drupal software assigns each user account a unique numerical user ID (uid). This uid is used internally by the system to track user actions such as content creation or editing. The numerical user IDs are never reused even if their user accounts are subsequently blocked or deleted.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS/DKANusers are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a unique username, password and email address for the LINCS system based on the system for allocating user accounts described in AC-2. Each request must be based on a business need and is limited to only the access requirements for that individual to perform his/her identified role within LINCS. Requests for identifier assignment follows the process described in AC-2 and are authorized to perform actions according to the user account roles described in AC-3.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following:  AWS identifier authorization to assign information system CivicActions identifiers.



### Part b)

#### Drupal specific control support

In accordance with CivicActions Identification and Authentication (IA) Policy <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/blob/master/IA-Policy.md>, CivicActions internal users are uniquely identified by creation of an organizational account with a username based on each user's full first and last name.

When Drupal user accounts are created, users' email addresses are verified by sending a single-use activation link to the user’s mailbox. The email recipient then uses the activation link to log in to the website and supply a password which must meet the system's password complexity requirements.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Users assigned to system requiring access to the lincs.ed.gov system require authorization by the employee’s manager with LINCS’s admin group completing the the creation of the account.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Once the initial Site Manager accounts are created for LINCS, they subsequently are responsible for assigning accounts and privileges to other customer users in their organization.

Identifiers for devices that access the system use the same username, email address and password protocol as the identifiers provided to human users of the system and undergo the same process of review by the LINCS admin group. The LINCS admin group is responsible for assigning a unique username that identifies the device as well as an email address that can be used for account verification.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following:  assignment of identifiers for CivicActions admins within the AWS platform.

> 
> Security control type: Hybrid


### Part a)

#### Drupal specific control support

Refer to control AC-2 in this SSP for further details on account provisioning.

CivicActions will create and maintain an initial Drupal Administrator (highest level of Drupal Account). New Administrators are able to provide additional Administrator access at their own discretion, and are ultimately responsible for managing their own Administrator and other user accounts that they create.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Authentication for LINCS internal personnel are created during the personnel assignment process where requests are made to the LINCS admin group for proper access levels.  The LINCS admin group verifies the identity of the user. The website performs further verification by sending an email to the user's mailbox containing a single-use activation link which must be used to log in to the account for the first time and to create a password.

Prior to issuing initial Drupal Site Manager (highest level of Client User Account) system credentials (user ID and initial password),  the CivicActions Implementation staff verifies the user’s request for access, typically during the initial kick-off call when all stakeholders are present. New Site Managers are able to provide additional Site Manager access at their own discretion, and are ultimately responsible for managing their own Site Manager and other user accounts that they create.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following: identity verification of the CivicActions admins.



### Part b)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

Initial authenticator content (a unique email address – not previously used in any other account) is provided by the customer. CivicActions Implementation staff use that email address to provide the new user with Admin access. Before the Admin has access, they are required to create their own passwords; however, the passwords Admins choose must conform to the password criteria defined:

* Enforce password history = 24

* Minimum password length = 15



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following:  internal authentication for CivicActions admins.

### Part c)

#### Drupal specific control support

The system partially inherits this control from Drupal standard password strength mechanisms.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

When entering a user account password upon initial login to lincs.ed.gov, all users must comply with the following strict password policies, which are enforced by the website's software configuration:

* Password must contain at least one punctuation (not whitespace or an alphanumeric) character.

* Password must contain at least one uppercase character.

* Password must contain at least one lowercase character.

* Password must be at least 15 characters in length.

* Password must contain at least one digit.

The system partially inherits this control from Drupal standard password management.

All password changes/resets are recorded in the website's "Drupal watchdog" logs.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

LINCS Site Managers have the ability to add additional Site Managers to their account. The Site Manager needs only a unique email address to do so. All password requirements are set at the account level, and will apply to all user accounts. Password requirements are not editable for Site Managers.

Disabling the access of Site Managers to lincs.ed.gov is the responsibility of LINCS.

LINCS is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts, which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the website's software configuration, as described above

In accordance with lincs.ed.gov site configuration, the following implementation administrative procedures exist for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.

* Initial authenticator distribution:  Users receive a one-time login link by email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log in and then must enter a password themselves which complies with the password complexity requirements described in IA-4(b).

* Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators:  Users who have forgotten their password may request a new password by submitting their username or email address. The website responds by emailing a one-time login link to the user's email address. After using the link to log in, the user is required to enter a new password.

* Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in the last 90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators and Site Managers may block any user account if they believe there is a reason to do so.



#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) US-East/West control support

The system partially inherits this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013 for the following:  administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators for CivicActions admin users of AWS.



### Part e)

#### Drupal specific control support

CivicActions/Drupal requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the application website enforces this. User accounts are assigned a randomly-generated and unguessable default password that is not shared with anyone, including site Administrators. Once the user logs in and creates a new password, the default password erased from the website's database.



#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

CivicActions application password re-use requirements are configurable in accordance with LINCS own security requirements. However, changing the password age requirement requires a code setting change that therefore needs to be planned and approved by CivicActions' Change Control Board before being implemented.

> Security control type: Hybrid


### Part a)

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

CivicActions manages the LINCS system, based on CivicActions' DKAN software, which is based on the open source Drupal platform. lincs.ed.gov is managed by CivicActions using the Agile software development methodology, which provides a continuous System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology that is consistent with the LINCS Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC). CivicActions' Agile management of the website continues to improve the software through ongoing planned code releases. Each point release introduces code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:

* Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request project of CivicActions' ticketing system which describes the overall goals of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in CivicActions' Github ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release. Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades to newer versions of the Drupal software, the DKAN distribution, and the Drupal contributed modules that have been used to build the website.

Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from a variety of sources:

* Customer support requests received by CivicActions' customer support team

* Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by LINCS

* Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis of those incidents performed by CivicActions' Open Source Support Engineering team

* Security notifications received by CivicActions' security team from the Drupal security team and other software vendors

* Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by CivicActions' security team

* Issues reported by CivicActions' Open Data Engineering and product engineering teams

* Security issues reported by AWS Cloud through its monitoring and ticketing system for lincs.ed.gov

* Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks. Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which CivicActions developers select a list of tickets to be implemented. The developer team holds daily coordination meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which issues have been resolved and which need further work.

* Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate code branch within CivicActions' git repository for lincs.ed.gov and tested using the CircleCI continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on a ticket is completed, the developer creates a pull request, and the changes are submitted to at lease one other developer for review to ensure they meet functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull request is merged into git repository's development branch for the planned code release.

* Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and configuration necessary to implement the changes is merged into the website's staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.

* User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release notes to be shared with the customer.

* Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production and presented to CivicActions' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.

* Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately prior to the deployment.

* Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a security scan using the a web vulnerability scanner.

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

The LINCS system is configured based on the DKAN distribution of Drupal. Administrator documentation for the Drupal application framework and contributed modules are located at http://drupal.org/documentation. The Drupal documentation repository is maintained by the Drupal Documentation Team: http://drupal.org/contribute/documentation. Public documentation related to DKAN is maintained by CivicActions and is located at: http://docs.getdkan.com. CivicActions also maintains additional documentation in a "DKAN Guide" that is updated with each new point release of DKAN, which happens roughly every three months. The latest point release is DKAN 7.x-1.15, so the current guide is named  "DKAN 7.x-1.15 Guide." Administrator documentation for DKAN is included In the DKAN Guide.

Some features of lincs.ed.gov were built on a custom basis and are not part of standard DKAN. Administrator documentation for those custom features is maintained in CivicActions' Github documentation system in a Github page named "LINCS Custom Development."

Since DKAN is an open source project, all DKAN standard documentation is available to unauthenticated and authenticated users. Administrator documentation for custom features that were built specifically for lincs.ed.gov is only shared with CivicActions personnel.

CivicActions' Open Data Platform Engineering team maintains documentation for developers in Github explaining how to create copies of the lincs.ed.gov website for testing purposes. This documentation includes instructions to sanitize the website's database when creating test copies of the website. (For example, email addresses and user passwords are obfuscated.)

Information system security engineering principles are applied in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the application system.

Sound security policy, developing layered protections, and controls have been established as the foundation for design throughout the SDLC defined in control SA-3. Security requirements are incorporated into that SDLC, as described previously.

CivicActions uses a development-stage-production testing and management workflow as part of the CivicActions development model. Changes are first tested on a development environment, then moved to a staging environment for further testing. Once the client approves the changes, a backup is made of the production environment, and the changes are then deployed. More information regarding this model can be found in CM-3 and CM-4.The CivicActions organization ensures that all its developers are trained on how to build secure software, that security controls have been tailored to meet business and operational needs.

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

This is a planned control.

CivicActions employs Jenkins (https://jenkins.io/), an open source "task runner" software system, to run scripts that perform common automated site maintenance tasks on lincs.ed.gov. These tasks include:

* Re-running the DKAN Data Harvester

* Rebuilding the website's data.json feed

* Checking the site periodically to perform uptime monitoring and to automatically restore the site to normal functioning if it detects a service interruption.

Jenkins is installed on a website created by CivicActions that is currently hosted on the Linode web hosting platform (www.linode.com). Linode is not FedRAMP certified. We plan to move the Jenkins website onto a FedRAMP-certified hosting platform by the end of 2016.

CivicActions does not currently have any other dedicated interconnections between information system components within the authorization boundary and external third-party vendor information systems for the purposes of storing, processing, or transmitting federal customer data. If additional external information system services are required in the future, CivicActions shall employ appropriate security controls in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

LINCS is hosted on the AWS Cloud platform, which was approved under the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 17 March 2016. As such, AWS is already a FedRAMP-approved CSP and currently meets the FedRAMP requirements.

#### LINCS specific control or LINCS Responsibility

In accordance with the LINCS/DKAN Configuration Management Plan (<https://github.com/NuCivic/healthdata/wiki/configuration-management-plan>), integrity verification tools are employed on the LINCS system to detect unauthorized changes. The first line of monitoring is that CivicActions developers use the git source code version control system to manage all source code running on lincs.ed.gov.  The git repository is hosted by AWS Cloud as part of its PaaS hosting service. CivicActions maintains its own separate clone of the git repository which mirrors the AWS repository and is hosted on GitHub. All code objects, branches and git commits are check-summed before they are stored and can then be referred to by that checksum. This prevents anyone from to changing the contents of any file or directory without Git detecting the unauthorized change. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy.

As initiated by the CM process, any changes to the website's code submitted by a developer must be peer reviewed by another member from the Open Data Platform Engineering or the DKAN Product Engineering team. All changes in source code are required to submit the source code through the PHP Authenticator to verify it is formatted correctly.
