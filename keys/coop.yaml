  overview: # Section 1.0
    The Project facilitate collaboration between the communities the latest
    Enterprise 2.0 technologies, along with traditional communication tools
    will be used to ensure users can easily find and disseminate information
    between colleagues. The system is based on a content management system.

    The system is available to users over a traditional web interface using a
    desktop or laptop, but also through a mobile version of the web site
    accessible through mobile devices (phone and tablets). By enabling the
    latest collaboration techniques the Project will help the Client to fulfill
    their mission in a more efficient manner. System recovery time of 24 hours
    has been determined to provide a cost of recovery consummate with the value
    of the functionality provided by the Client. In light of this schedule, full
    system recovery can occur within the time frame, sparing the cost of a “hot”
    or “warm” site.

      The primary focus of a COOP revolves around the protection of the two most
      important assets of any organization: personnel and data. The protection of
      personnel is inherited fully by the FedRAMP certification granted to the Amazon
      Web Services (AWS) cloud upon with the Project is built. Further, protection of
      data from fire, flood, power outages and other natural disasters is inherited
      through FedRAMP. Additional measures beyond the inherited capabilities are laid
      out in the Project Contingency Plan.
    organization: # Section 2.3
      description: >-
        In the event of a disaster or other circumstances that may bring about
        the need for contingency operations, the normal organization of the
        Project will shift into that of the contingency organization. The focus
        the Project will shift from the current structure and function of
        "business as usual" to the structure and function of the Project working
        towards the resumption of time-sensitive business operations. The teams
        associated with the plan represent functions of a department or support
        functions developed to respond, resume, recover, or restore operations or
        facilities of the Project and its affected systems. Status and progress
        updates will be reported by each team leader to the plan owner. Close
        coordination must be maintained with the Project management and each of
        the teams throughout the resumption and recovery operations. The Project
        contingency organization’s primary duties are::

        * Protect information assets until normal business operations are resumed

        * Ensure that a viable capability exists to respond to an incident

        * Manage all response, resumption, recovery, and restoration activities

        * Support and communicate with employees, system administrators, security
          officers, and managers

        * Accomplish rapid and efficient resumption of time-sensitive business
          operations, technology, and functional support areas

        * Ensure regulatory requirements are satisfied

        * Exercise resumption and recovery expenditure decisions

        * Streamline the reporting of resumption and recovery progress between the
          teams and management of each system

    success_factors: >- #Section 2.5
      This section addresses the factors and issues that specifically apply to the
      Project COOP that have been identified to be critical to its successful
      implementation. These factors are as follows:

      * Commitment by upper management to Continuity of Operations Planning and
        Disaster Recovery.

      * Budgetary commitment to Disaster Recovery.

      * Modifications and improvements to the current scheduling procedures for the
        retention and transportation of backup files to the offsite storage facility.

      * Development and execution of the necessary Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs),
        Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

        The development of recovery strategies and work-arounds requires technical
        input, creativity, and pragmatism. The best way to create workable strategies
        and cohesive teams that leverage out-of-the-box thinking is to involve
        management and information resource management personnel in an ongoing,
        informative dialogue. The Project management has developed an agile
        Contingency Plan that is maintained in Git and regularly reviewed and updated
        by the development, operations and security teams.
      team_members: >- # Section 3.1.2
        The Project COOP, Contingency Plan and Security Incident Response team
        members are listed in the Project Incident Response Team Contact Details
        (private Google) spreadsheet which is linked to the Project Contingency
        Plan. Included are processes for:

        * Incident Notification and Assessment

        * Plan Activation

        * Damage Assessment

        * Remediation

        * Disaster Recovery

        * Retrospective (lessons learned)

      vital_records: >- # Section 3.2
        Vital records and important documentation are backed up and stored offsite and
        include any documents or documentation that is essential to the operations of
        an organization, such as personnel records, software documentation, legal
        documentation, legislative documentation, benefits documentation, etc. The
        following documentation will be available:

        * Security related Information Technology (IT) policy & procedure memoranda, circulars, publications

        * Complete hardware and software listings

        * System testing plans/procedures

        * System configuration

        * Data backup/restoration procedures

  testing: >- # Section 4
    The Project COOP will be maintained routinely and exercised/tested at least
    annually. Contingency procedures must be tested periodically to ensure the
    effectiveness of the plan. The scope, objective, and measurement criteria of each
    exercise will be determined and coordinated by the Project COOP Coordinator on a
    “per event” basis. The purpose of exercising and testing the plan is to continually
    refine resumption and recovery procedures to reduce the potential for failure.
    There are several different types of tests that are useful for measuring different
    objectives. The schedule for testing is as follows:

    * Desktop testing on a quarterly basis

    * One structured walk-through per year

    * One integrated business operations/information systems exercise per year

    The COOP Coordinator, Contingency System Coordinators, and Team Leaders, together
    with the Project Management will determine end-user participation

  backups: # Section 6
    backup_capabilities: >- # Section 6.1
      All of the Project systems are dependent on the preservation of data,
      including software code and databases. In order to minimize the impact of
      a disaster, it is extremely important to protect the sensitivity or
      confidentiality of data; to preserve the authenticity and accuracy of
      data, and to maintain the availability of data. These three goals are
      commonly defined as “Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability”. The
      protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is
      of singular importance in information security and disaster recovery
      planning. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data are intrinsic
      to disaster recovery planning.

      For data backups, the system utilizes hourly encrypted snapshots of the file
      system, utilizing AWS elastic block storage (EBS) devices. A full set of these
      snapshot images is transferred daily to the secondary geographic location
      (US-West) for localized disaster recovery. The system also makes full logical
      backups of the primary the Project site database and stores them on virtualized
      storage.
    backup_schedule:
      steps:
        - Hourly snapshot backups of all operating system, application software and data. These are retained for 24 hours.
        - Daily snapshot backups of all operating system, application software and data. These are retained for 30 days. Each backup is also transferred to the secondary geographic location (US-West).
        - Daily full logical backups of the primary the Project site database. These are retained on filesystem for 6 days, with additional weekly backups retained for 35 days, and additional monthly backups retained for 150 days. The backup file system itself is also part of the daily snapshot backups and made available on the secondary geographic location (US-West).
      additional:
        text: |
          In addition:

          * Manual backups are triggered and verified before any system or application software release.
          * Important backups (e.g. prior to major data structure changes) can be added to an extended retention list, and will be retained indefinitely or until they are identified for removal.
          * Configuration of systems and services is maintained in distributed Git repositories.

          Proprietary third party software is external so backups are not required. Third party software packaged that the Project calls out to include:
          * StatusCake
          * OpsGenie
          * JIRA

    restore: >- # Section 6.4
      There are three basic types of software recovery that must be anticipated, namely,
      data error recovery, hard disk recovery, and virus recovery. The guidelines for
      these procedures are as follows:


      * Data Error Recovery – Use the last hourly backup. Overwrite the data with the
      contents of the backup, using the appropriate vendor software.

      * Hard Disk Crash – Use the last hourly backup to re-install the system and
      application software.

      * Virus – Once the start date of the virus has been determined, use the last weekly backup tape before that date to restore the system and application software.


      In the event of serious infrastructure level incidents there are two scenarios:


      * The first would be to use an alternate availability zone within the same
        US-East geographic region - in this case, the active disk volumes are already
        available and could just be attached to server instances in the alternate zone
        - in this instance, no backup snapshot is required, and the Elastic IPs can be
        instantly directed to the new servers.

      * The second would be if the entire US-East region became unavailable (all
        availability zones). In this case we would bring up servers in the secondary
        US-West site, utilizing the most recent daily snapshots, and then update the
        domain name (DNS) entries to point to the new instance IPs.

    contingency_log: >- # Section 6.5
      Assessments and results of any exercise or real contingency operations will be
      logged in JIRA from available documentation after recovery and restoration.
      Sections include lessons learned, unanticipated difficulties, staff participation,
      restoration of system backups, description of any permanently lost data, and shut
      down of temporary equipment used for the resumption, recovery, and restoration.
