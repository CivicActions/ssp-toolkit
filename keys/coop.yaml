  overview: >- # Section 1.0
    The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) GlobalNET system is a Department
    of Defense (DoD) approved and secure online environment for professionals to
    collaborate and share information. GlobalNET provides online management tools
    to deliver courses and events to facilitate human networking between personnel
    from defense related organizations around the world with the goal of
    identifying and ameliorating potential areas of conflict before they become
    violent conflicts.


    To facilitate collaboration between the communities the latest Enterprise 2.0
    technologies, along with traditional communication tools will be used to ensure
    users can easily find and disseminate information between colleagues. The
    system is based on the Drupal content management system (CMS) extended by
    sophisticated group and permissions management. To further enhance
    collaboration GlobalNET provides video teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities via
    Adobe Connect and will soon have team communications supported by Mattermost.
    These tools help to promote real time collaboration between users of the system.


    The system is available to users over a traditional web interface using a
    desktop or laptop, but also through a mobile version of the web site accessible
    through mobile devices (phone and tablets). By enabling the latest
    collaboration techniques the GlobalNET system will help the DSCA to fulfill
    their mission in a more efficient manner. System recovery time of 24 hours has
    been determined to provide a cost of recovery consummate with the value of the
    functionality provided by GlobalNET. In light of this schedule, full system
    recovery can occur within the time frame, sparing the cost of a “hot” or “warm”
    site.

    objectives: >- # Section 2.2
      The primary focus of a COOP revolves around the protection of the two most
      important assets of any organization: personnel and data. The protection of
      personnel is inherited fully by the FedRAMP certification granted to the Amazon
      Web Services (AWS) cloud upon with GlobalNET is built. Further, protection of
      data from fire, flood, power outages and other natural disasters is inherited
      through FedRAMP. Additional measures beyond the inherited capabilities are laid
      out in the [GlobalNET Contingency Plan](https://git.civicactions.net/dsca/
      documentation/blob/master/Security_Appendices/contingency-plan.md) (accessible by
      authorized GlobalNET team members and DSCA representatives).
    organization: # Section 2.3
      description: >-
        In the event of a disaster or other circumstances that may bring about the need
        for contingency operations, the normal organization of GlobalNET will shift
        into that of the contingency organization. The focus GlobalNET will shift from
        the current structure and function of “business as usual” to the structure and
        function of GlobalNET working towards the resumption of time-sensitive business
        operations. The teams associated with the plan represent functions of a
        department or support functions developed to respond, resume, recover, or
        restore operations or facilities of GlobalNET and its affected systems. Status
        and progress updates will be reported by each team leader to the plan owner.
        Close coordination must be maintained with GlobalNET management and each of the
        teams throughout the resumption and recovery operations. The GlobalNET
        contingency organization’s primary duties are:
      duties:
        -
          Protect information assets until normal business operations are resumed
        -
          Ensure that a viable capability exists to respond to an incident
        -
          Manage all response, resumption, recovery, and restoration activities
        -
          Support and communicate with employees, system administrators, security officers, and managers
        -
          Accomplish rapid and efficient resumption of time-sensitive business operations, technology, and functional support areas
        -
          Ensure regulatory requirements are satisfied
        -
          Exercise resumption and recovery expenditure decisions
        -
          Streamline the reporting of resumption and recovery progress between the teams and management of each system
    success_factors: | #Section 2.5
      This section addresses the factors and issues that specifically apply to the GlobalNET COOP project that have been identified to be critical to its successful implementation. These factors are as follows:

      * Commitment by upper management to Continuity of Operations Planning and Disaster Recovery.
      * Budgetary commitment to Disaster Recovery.
      * Modifications and improvements to the current scheduling procedures for the retention and transportation of backup files to the offsite storage facility.
      * Development and execution of the necessary Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs), Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

      planning_and_updates: >- # Section 3.1.1
        The development of recovery strategies and work-arounds requires technical input, creativity, and pragmatism. The best way to create workable strategies and cohesive teams that leverage out-of-the-box thinking is to involve management and information resource management personnel in an ongoing, informative dialogue. The GlobalNET management has developed an agile [Contingency Plan](https://git.civicactions.net/dsca/documentation/blob/master/Security_Appendices/contingency-plan.md) that is maintained in Git and regularly reviewed and updated by the development, operations and security teams.

        The GlobalNET COOP, Contingency Plan and Security Incident Response team
        members are listed in the GlobalNET Incident Response Team Contact Details
        (private Google) spreadsheet which is linked to the GlobalNET Contingency
        Plan. Included are processes for:


        * Incident Notification and Assessment

        * Plan Activation

        * Damage Assessment

        * Remediation

        * Disaster Recovery

        * Retrospective (lessons learned)
      vital_records: >- # Section 3.2
        Vital records and important documentation are backed up and stored offsite and
        include any documents or documentation that is essential to the operations of
        an organization, such as personnel records, software documentation, legal
        documentation, legislative documentation, benefits documentation, etc. The
        following documentation will be available:


        * Security related Information Technology (IT) policy & procedure memoranda, circulars, publications

        * Complete hardware and software listings

        * System testing plans/procedures

        * System configuration

        * Data backup/restoration procedures
  testing: >- # Section 4
    The GlobalNET COOP will be maintained routinely and exercised/tested at least
    annually. Contingency procedures must be tested periodically to ensure the
    effectiveness of the plan. The scope, objective, and measurement criteria of each
    exercise will be determined and coordinated by the GlobalNET COOP Coordinator on a
    “per event” basis. The purpose of exercising and testing the plan is to continually
    refine resumption and recovery procedures to reduce the potential for failure.
    There are several different types of tests that are useful for measuring different
    objectives. The schedule for testing is as follows:


    * Desktop testing on a quarterly basis

    * One structured walk-through per year

    * One integrated business operations/information systems exercise per year


    The COOP Coordinator, Contingency System Coordinators, and Team Leaders, together
    with the GlobalNET Management will determine end-user participation

  backups: # Section 6
    backup_capabilities: >- # Section 6.1
      All of the GlobalNET systems are dependent on the preservation of data, including
      software code and databases. In order to minimize the impact of a disaster, it is
      extremely important to protect the sensitivity or confidentiality of data; to
      preserve the authenticity and accuracy of data, and to maintain the availability
      of data. These three goals are commonly defined as “Confidentiality, Integrity,
      and Availability”. The protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and
      availability of data is of singular importance in information security and
      disaster recovery planning. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
      are intrinsic to disaster recovery planning.

      For data backups, the system utilizes hourly encrypted snapshots of the file
      system, utilizing AWS elastic block storage (EBS) devices. A full set of these
      snapshot images is transferred daily to the secondary geographic location
      (US-West) for localized disaster recovery. The system also makes full logical
      backups of the primary GlobalNET site database and stores them on virtualized
      storage.
    backup_schedule:
      steps:
        -
          Hourly snapshot backups of all operating system, application software and data. These are retained for 24 hours.
        -
          Daily snapshot backups of all operating system, application software and data. These are retained for 30 days. Each backup is also transferred to the secondary geographic location (US-West).
        -
          Daily full logical backups of the primary GlobalNET site database. These are retained on filesystem for 6 days, with additional weekly backups retained for 35 days, and additional monthly backups retained for 150 days. The backup file system itself is also part of the daily snapshot backups and made available on the secondary geographic location (US-West).
      additional:
        text: |
          In addition:

          * Manual backups are triggered and verified before any system or application software release.

          * Important backups (e.g. prior to major data structure changes) can be added to an extended retention list, and will be retained indefinitely or until they are identified for removal.

          * Configuration of systems and services is maintained in distributed Git repositories.

          Proprietary third party software is external so backups are not required. Third party software packaged that GlobalNET calls out to include:

          * Adobe Connect

          * Clickatell

          * StatusCake

          * OpsGenie

          * JIRA
    restore: >- # Section 6.4
      There are three basic types of software recovery that must be anticipated, namely,
      data error recovery, hard disk recovery, and virus recovery. The guidelines for
      these procedures are as follows:


      * Data Error Recovery – Use the last hourly backup. Overwrite the data with the
      contents of the backup, using the appropriate vendor software.

      * Hard Disk Crash – Use the last hourly backup to re-install the system and
      application software.

      * Virus – Once the start date of the virus has been determined, use the last weekly backup tape before that date to restore the system and application software.


      In the event of serious infrastructure level incidents there are two scenarios:


      * The first would be to use an alternate availability zone within the same US-East geographic region - in this case, the active disk volumes are already available and could just be attached to server instances in the alternate zone - in this instance, no backup snapshot is required, and the Elastic IPs can be instantly directed to the new servers.

      * The second would be if the entire US-East region became unavailable (all availability zones). In this case we would bring up servers in the secondary US-West site, utilizing the most recent daily snapshots, and then update the domain name (DNS) entries to point to the new instance IPs.
    contingency_log: >- # Section 6.5
      Assessments and results of any exercise or real contingency operations will be
      logged in JIRA from available documentation after recovery and restoration.
      Sections include lessons learned, unanticipated difficulties, staff participation,
      restoration of system backups, description of any permanently lost data, and shut
      down of temporary equipment used for the resumption, recovery, and restoration.
