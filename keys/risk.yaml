  risk: # Project Risks
    description: >-
      The following is a list of project risks that are known at the start of the project. As the project progresses, new risks will come to light and this list will be updated. The monthly status report “Areas of Concern” section will include the most up to date risks on a monthly basis, and those will be copied to this list and submitted annually.
    risks:
      -
        name: CAC
        description: Obtaining CAC can be challenging without sponsorship
        mitigation: Tejas to follow up with respective members from DSCA on a periodic basis to get traction on this
        owner: Tejas/Fen
      -
        name: Security Clearances
        description: This step would be required to obtain CAC access. So this is a blocker for CAC access
        mitigation: Tejas to follow up with respective members from DSCA on a periodic basis to get traction on this
        owner: Tejas
      -
        name: GovCloud Migration
        description: CivicActions provided information based on initial GovCloud related testing to DSCA. The risk is related to latency and also for port whitelisting for access as per GovCloud requirements
        mitigation: DSCA members ( Brian as POC ) to help with bringing this information with appropriate department / groups and help with strategy to get around this
