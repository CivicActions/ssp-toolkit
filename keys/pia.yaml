  The _Secure Sockets Layer_ (_SSL_) is the standard technology for keeping
  an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is
  being sent between two systems. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the
  successor to SSL. The TLS protocol provides privacy and data integrity
  between two or more communicating computer applications, enabling private
  and reliable communications between authenticated identities.


  The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) defined an
  information-security framework to improve computer and network security
  within the federal government. The National Institute of Standards &
  Technology (NIST), a non-regulatory agency of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce has
  developed a set of standards and guidelines (800-series publications)
  further define this framework.


  The _Risk Management Framework_ (_RMF_) - outlined in NIST Special
  Publication 800-37 - defines a system lifecycle approach for information
  systems and organizations. A catalog of security and privacy controls -
  defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 - outlines the management,
  operational and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of the system and its information.


  The Project implements the controls defined for low impact systems in the Risk
  Management Framework, including the use of SSL/TLS for securing data in motion.
