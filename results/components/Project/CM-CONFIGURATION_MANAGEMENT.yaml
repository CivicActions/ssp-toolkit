      A CM process has been established and documented in the
      Project CMP. All updates are made in accordance with the
      procedures outlined in the CMP. The CM process establishes a baseline of
      hardware, software, firmware and documentation, as well as changes
      thereto, throughout the development and life cycle of the information
      system. CM ensures the control of the information system through its life
      cycle. It assures that additions, deletions, or changes made to the
      Project system do not unintentionally or unknowingly
      diminish security. If the change is major, the security of the system
      must be re-analyzed.

      An Information Security Program is in place to ensure all security-centric
      impacts to the Project are properly analyzed and conducted
      by personnel with information security responsibilities (i.e.,
      Project SSO, IT Security Officer, etc.). These individuals
      have the appropriate skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes
      to the Project and their associated security ramifications.
      In support of continuous monitoring and to ensure the Project
      system lifecycle is fully sustained, a risk assessment process, be it
      formal or informal, is performed when changes are occur. This ensures
      that Client Full Name understands the security impacts and can
      determine if additional security controls are required.

      The Project is configured in compliance with the
      applicable baseline security standards. The Department and its technical
      support staff configure the security settings of all IT products to the
      most restrictive mode consistent with information system operational
      requirements. Project utilizes the NIST Special Publication
      800-70 for guidance on configuration settings (checklists) for information
      technology products. When security setting checklist are not available
      from NIST for a particular device, good security engineering practices
      along with manufacture guidelines is used to develop the security settings.
      The CM Manager conducts configuration audits to ensure baseline compliance
      and documentation of hardware/software configurations throughout the system
      lifecycle.

      Currently, deviations do not exist for established configuration settings.
      In the event this changes, the following notes the process that will take
      place.

      The CivicActions CCB, identifies, approves, and documents
      exceptions to mandatory configuration settings for individual components
      within its cloud offering only when operationally necessary. All variances
      identified during the monthly and annual system testing scans that must be accepted for operational purposes are tracked.
