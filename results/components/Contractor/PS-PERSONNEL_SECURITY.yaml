      Office of Human Resources determines that significant changes must be
      made to the position risk descriptions the Office of Human Resources works
      in coordination with the CivicActions Security Office to
      implement changes as required.

      Prospective CivicActions employees undergo background checks
      commensurate with the individual’s job duties, the classification of the
      information they will access, and the risks associated with the role. At
      the discretion of the CivicActions Security Office, these
      checks may also be conducted on contractors and/or third party users in
      cases where they will have access to application data that is not meant
      to be consumed by the public. In these instances, the Security Office
      will instruct the Office of Human Resources to conduct a background check
      before granting access to the information system.

      Information system access is terminated immediately upon the voluntary or
      involuntary departure of an employee. In the case of involuntary departure,
      in addition to immediate termination of system access, at no point is a
      departing employee allowed access to any part of the
      CivicActions infrastructure.

      In the case of voluntary departure, employees are permitted access to
      the information system for the duration of their off-boarding period. The
      departing employee’s manager is responsible for informing the Information
      Technology department when the employee off-boarding period concludes. At
      this time system and facility, access is terminated.

      The terminated user’s accounts are disabled and all access associated

      The employee's manager or the Office of Human Resources conducts exit
      interviews with all employees who leave CivicActions
      voluntarily. There is a general discussion about the process of turning
      in any/all company-issued devices, laptops, etc.

      CivicActions employees provide their own equipment that must
      be hardened to security requirements depending upon their roles and duties.
      CivicActions supplies two-factor authentication tokens that
      become the property of the employee.

      Some employees may receive company-issued hardware for working on
      particular projects. These items are collected before the employee exits
      CivicActions. In the case of an involuntary termination, the
      Office of Human Resources works to collect company-issued devices and
      provides paperwork highlighting confidential protections for customers.

      Access to CivicActions information and information systems is
      always shared so that the termination of an individual will not prevent
      CivicActions from having access to needed resources.
  - key: f
    text: >
      When a person is terminated, a standard off-boarding process is used to
      notify management and CivicActions' Operations staff, and to
      track the process of disabling access to the information system/information
      system components. The CivicActions Operations staff and
      Security Office are given at least four hours notice to schedule the
      deactivation of access upon termination. Deactivation is a manual process
      that is tracked via a Trello card in order to meet the four hour
      turnaround time before termination.

      When an employee, third party personnel and/or contractor is transferred
      to a new project or position within CivicActions, they may
      maintain access to the previous system they were working on in order to
      facilitate the process of maintenance and knowledge transfer. However, as
      part of the practices of account management (AC-2) and least privilege
      (AC-6), regular audits of privileged users are conducted and access
      privileges may be removed when no longer needed. Additionally, adherence
      to specific client SLAs may enhance the frequency of such audits or the
      timeliness of privilege removal during personnel transfer.
