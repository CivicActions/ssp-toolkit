      CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to
      personnel a configuration management policy that addresses purpose,
      scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
      organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the
      implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information is
      maintained in the CivicActions Configuration Management (CM)
      Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions
      Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.

      Configuration changes are overseen by the Change Control Board (CCB)
      consisting of the System Owner, Project Manager, CivicActions
      Operations staff and the engineering team.

      Security impact analysis is conducted and documented within the Change
      Request (CR) process described in CM-3(b). All proposed configuration-
      controlled changes to the application are tested first in a sandboxed
      development environment before being pushed to a staging environment to
      be tested by another developer and by the Engineering team prior to final
      approval from CCB to move changes to the production environment.

      All software installed in the system environment must be first approved
      via the CCB resulting in a Change Request (CR) being initiated and
      executed. Software installation on the computing nodes within the
