      AWS built-in features dynamically build and maintain an inventory of system components
      (infrastructure inventory)


      1. AWS built-in features provide an accurate, real time inventory of all infrastructure system and network components within the customer account and provides a single view for granularity for tracking and reporting.

      2. AWS built-in features provide an accurate, real time inventory of all infrastructure system and network components within the AWS account, and  AWS CloudFormation creates a unique set of stack names, and associated resource names  incorporate the stack name, for tracking components deployed by CloudFormation templates that align with an authorization boundary.

      3. AWS built-in features provide a level of granularity for tracking and reporting on all infrastructure system and network components and configuration settings for those components.

      4. AWS built-in features provide all available information about all infrastructure system and network components to achieve effective component accountability.

      AWS built-in features provides a dynamically updated inventory of all infrastructure
      system and network components within the customer account. The AWS management console
      and AWS API calls support the capability for the organization to review the inventory.
