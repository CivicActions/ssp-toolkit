##### Contractor

Both regular and ad hoc training to all CivicActions personnel, including those who support the system infrastructure and applications, is provided. All employees and contractors must complete Security Awareness training upon being hired and at least annually thereafter. CivicActions Operations staff will not create accounts for individuals until they have successfully completed the trainings. Additional training will be provided as required by system changes. Training takes the following forms:

Annual Knowledge Survey (i.e., Security Awareness Training): All employees are required to review trainings covering Security Awareness. After the training, a survey-style security awareness test is taken by employees. All CivicActions personnel are required to complete and pass the survey, and new employees are required to pass before being granted access to the Information System. In order to successfully pass the test, a score of 80% is required. This survey tests CivicActions personnel’s knowledge of critical security subjects, policies and procedures. Results from this survey are compiled by the Office of Human Resources and used to refine future training efforts.

Ad Hoc Security Awareness: The CivicActions' Security Office oversees the approximately bi-monthly distribution of security awareness tips and articles to all CivicActions employees. This can include general tips as well as articles tailored to the specific requirements of CivicActions users.

##### Project

Completion of role-based training is an annual requirement for personnel in roles with significant information security responsibilities that require specialized role-based training. Role-based cybersecurity training is developed and implemented to meet identified training needs and competencies associated with the various target audiences/functional roles (federal and contractor employees) that comprise the Client workforce, as is identified in and required by the FISMA and OMB A-130, Appendix III. The appropriate content of security training is determined based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific security requirements of the Department, PO and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. Annual training requirements may be met by completing one or more course(s) within the Department’s learning management systems, participating in instructor-led training provided by the OCIO, or completing an external role-based course or courses offered within their specific functional area of expertise.
