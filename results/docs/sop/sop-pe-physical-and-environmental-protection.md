## Introduction

### Purpose

The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) Information Assurance Services (IAS) publication Information Technology (IT) System Access Controls Standard of February 11, 2022 provides a comprehensive basis for management across all systems in the Department. This document provides specific guidance as defined and implemented by the Project.

### Scope

This system has been categorized as a FIPS-199 LOW system, and as such this document applies only to relevant controls, policies, processes and procedures as defined within the system.

## Standards

### PE-01 Physical And Environmental Protection Policy And Procedures

This Physical Environment control associated with hardware components within AWS is generally either partially or fully inherited from the AWS physical infrastructure, while the customer organization is responsible for any part of the control that is applicable to customer-controlled equipment and facilities, and the customer's configurable portion of the AWS logical infrastructure, including the Operating systems on Amazon EC2 instances and the customer's applications.

For the U.S. East, U.S. West, and GovCloud regions, this control is inherited from pre-existing Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) or JAB provisional Authority to Operate under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).

Refer to the AWS FedRAMP SSP artifacts, including the Control Implementation Summary and Customer Responsibility Matrix, available from the AWS Compliance Team. <https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/>


### PE-02 Physical Access Authorizations

This Physical Environment control associated with hardware components within AWS is generally either partially or fully inherited from the AWS physical infrastructure, while the customer organization is responsible for any part of the control that is applicable to customer-controlled equipment and facilities, and the customer's configurable portion of the AWS logical infrastructure, including the Operating systems on Amazon EC2 instances and the customer's applications.

For the U.S. East, U.S. West, and GovCloud regions, this control is inherited from pre-existing Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) or JAB provisional Authority to Operate under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).
