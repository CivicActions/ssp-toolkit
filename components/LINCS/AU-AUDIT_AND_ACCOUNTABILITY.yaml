    The LINCS Technology Project maintains a record of system activity by application
    process and by user activity. Audit and accountability policy and procedures are
    documented within the LINCS SSP. Security software features are used to automatically
    generate and store security audit log records for use in monitoring security-related
    events on all multi-user systems. The Department reviews and updates this policy as
    necessary and it was last updated in April 2008.
