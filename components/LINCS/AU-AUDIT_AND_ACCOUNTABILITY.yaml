      The LINCS Technology Project maintains a record of system activity by application
      process and by user activity. Audit and accountability policy and procedures
      are documented within the LINCS SSP. Security software features are used to
      automatically generate and store security audit log records for use in monitoring
      security-related events on all multi-user systems. The Department reviews and
      updates this policy as necessary and it was last updated in April 2008. Additional
      information is contained within the Department of Education Handbook for Information
      Assurance Security policy (Handbook OCIO-01).
