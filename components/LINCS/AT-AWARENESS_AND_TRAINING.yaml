      Completion of role-based training is an annual requirement for personnel in
      roles with significant information security responsibilities that require specialized
      role-based training. Role-based cybersecurity training is developed and implemented
      to meet identified training needs and competencies associated with the various
      target audiences/functional roles (federal and contractor employees) that comprise
      the Department workforce, as is identified in and required by the FISMA and
      OMB A-130, Appendix III. The appropriate content of security training is determined
      based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific
      security requirements of the Department, PO and the information systems to which
      personnel have authorized access. Annual training requirements may be met by
      completing one or more course(s) within the Department’s learning management
      systems, participating in instructor-led training provided by the OCIO, or completing
      an external role-based course or courses offered within their specific functional
      area of expertise.
