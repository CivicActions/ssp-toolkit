    Department of Education, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Handbook for
    Information Assurance Security Policy, Information Assurance Program (Handbook
    OCIO-01), which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to security
    awareness and training. The Department will ensure all users, including managers and
    senior executives, are exposed to basic information system security awareness
    materials before authorizing access to the system and at least annually
    thereafter. The Department documents and monitors all individual information system
    security training activities including basic security awareness training. The
    Department reviews and updates the policy as necessary.

    The Department personnel and contractor employees involved with the management,
    operation, programming, maintenance, or use of LINCS Technology Project system receive
    training in acceptable computer security practices prior to system access.

    All Department employees and contractors are required to complete annual IT security
    awareness training. This security awareness training covers issues and policies
    associated with information security, including end user security roles and
    responsibilities and rules of behavior. Some topics addressed in the training are:
    
    * Password protection
    
    * System rules of behavior
    
    * Protection of hardware, software, and data
    
    * Proper handling of copyrighted materials
    
    * Reporting of security breaches and violations
    
    * Proper procedures for software installation, uploading, and use on workstations.

    Completion of role-based training is an annual requirement for personnel in roles with
    significant information security responsibilities that require specialized role-based
    training. Role-based cybersecurity training is developed and implemented to meet
    identified training needs and competencies associated with the various target
    audiences/functional roles (federal and contractor employees) that comprise the
    Department workforce, as is identified in and required by the FISMA and OMB A-130,
    Appendix III. The appropriate content of security training is determined based on the
    assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific security
    requirements of the Department, PO and the information systems to which personnel have
    authorized access. Annual training requirements may be met by completing one or more
    course(s) within the Departmentâ€™s learning management systems, participating in
    instructor-led training provided by the OCIO, or completing an external role-based
    course or courses offered within their specific functional area of expertise.
