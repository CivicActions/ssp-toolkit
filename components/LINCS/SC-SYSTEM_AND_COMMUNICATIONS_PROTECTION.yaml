      System and communications protection policy and procedures are formally documented
      in the Department of Education, Handbook for Information Assurance Security
      Policy (Handbook OCIO-01) and the LINCS SSP. The Department reviews and updates
      the policy as necessary and has been continually updated since April 2008.

      This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained
      from the Agency common control catalog.

      The LINCS Technology Project system is configured to reduce vulnerabilities
      in its operating system and applications to protect against Denial of Service
      (DoS) attacks.

      The LINCS support staff ensures the system is protected against or limits the
      effect of DoS attacks as specified in the Department of Education, Handbook
      for Information Security Incident Response and Reporting Procedures (Handbook
      OCIO-14).

      The LINCS Technology Project system has monitored and controlled communications
      at the external boundary of the information system and at key internal boundaries
      within the system, where appropriate. The LINCS allocates publicly accessible
      information system components (e.g., public web servers) specific IP address
      and port combinations. Public access into the organizationâ€™s internal networks
      is prevented except as appropriately mediated.

      Use of cryptographic key management for the LINCS system is not in use for at
      the time of implementation for authentication. CivicActions does not utilize
      customer agency supplied PIV credentials for access to customer instances of
      the LINCS. Access enforcement and authentication requirements for LINCS are
      described in AC-2 & IA-2. AWS platform does not utilize or manage cryptographic
      keys within the ACE boundary.
