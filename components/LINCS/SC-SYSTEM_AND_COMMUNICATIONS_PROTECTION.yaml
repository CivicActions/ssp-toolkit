  narrative: >
    The Department of Health and Human Service developed, documented and disseminated
    to personnel a system and communication policy  that addresses purpose, scope,
    roles, responsibilities, management committment, coordination among organizational
    entities, and compliance, and developed, documented and disseminated to personnel
    procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.The
    policy is stated in the Office of the Secretary Information Security Policy dated
    July 17, 2013 and the procedures are defined in the Office of the Secretary Procedures
    Handbook for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents
    will be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to
    the LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating the System and
    Communications Protection Policy and Procedures annually.  The Chief Operating Officer
    is responsible for approving System and Communications Protection. All procedures are
    consistent with requirements of FISMA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, applicable executive
    orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. These policies and
    procedures are applicable to the CivicActions staff administering the lincs.ed.gov
    information system.

    Denial of service (DoS) attacks impair the performance of network devices and
    server hosts, and thence the application itself.  HDG relies on the AWS platform
    for the protection of DoS attacks defined by LINCS SC-5.

    The lincs.ed.gov authorization boundary is completely contained within the AWS
    (ACE) Platform as a Service.

    The Drupal Server and Static Files computing nodes are the only computing nodes
    in the system that are exposed to the Internet. HDG employs both the AWS platform
    safeguards and the Drupal Watchdog module in monitoring and recording system events.
    All other computing nodes used in the system are isolated within AWS (ACE).

    The lincs.ed.gov authorization boundary is completely contained within the AWS

    Internal organizational networks (e.g. CivicActions private networks) are physically
    separate from the AWS platform and are protected by managed boundary devices that
    include FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules at all entry points.

    This is a planned control. Use of cryptographic key management for the HDG system
    is not in use for at the time of implementation for authentication. CivicActions
    does not utilize customer agency supplied PIV credentials for access to customer
    instances of the HDG. Access enforcement and authentication requirements for HDG
    are described in AC-2 & IA-2. AWS (ACE) platform does not utilize or manage
    cryptographic keys within the ACE boundary.

    HDG servers use SSH data is encrypted during transit. HDG utilizes HTTPS for any
    inbound traffic accessing the HDG and must authenticate according to established HDG
    access enforcement and authentication rules described in AC-2 & IA-2. AWS Cloud
    data volumes are encrypted with FIPS-142 encryption.

  narrative: >
    This control is inherited from AWS and currently does not employ a distributed,
    hierarchical namespace. HDG does not provide additional data origin authentication
    and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution
    data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries.
    HDG does not provide the means to indicate the security status of child zones
    and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification
    of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of
    a distributed, hierarchical namespace.
