    HDG extends the basic Drupal accounts providing user accounts for individuals who
    participate in the workflow of submitting and publishing datasets as well as blog
    about HDG-related activities. These HDG specific roles include:

    • Public Read-Access User: Anonymous account with read only access to datasets.
    The account also facilitates a feedback loop for federal dataset owners and dataset
    users. Public comment is available for discussing the government open data ecosystem.

    • Editor - Has the ability to edit and delete content, including content created by other users.

    • Blogger - Has the ability to create blog posts.

    • Content Creator - Can add datasets and data resources to the website.

    • Site Manager - Can perform common website configuration tasks but does not have
    the full range of permissions that are only given to users with the Administrator role.

    • Workflow Contributor - Has the ability to create content that is "moderated,"
    meaning it is not published for general public viewing until it has been reviewed
    and approved by a moderator.

    • Workflow Moderator - Has the ability to review and approve moderated content.

    • Workflow Supervisor - Has the ability to assign and remove Workflow Contributor
    and Workflow Moderator roles to other users.

    • API Consumer:  HDG provides a read-only API that lets API consumers retrieve metadata
    about datasets stored in the system and allows programmatic retrieval of the data,
    which is stored in each dataset. Individual administrative users are created as
    members of the "admin" group using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) feature.
