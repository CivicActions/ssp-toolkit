      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained
      from the Agency common control catalog.

      Access control policy and procedures are documented in the LINCS SSP. Access
      to LINCS Technology Project operational information or system resources is limited
      to only authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access
      control policies to protect the integrity of the LINCS Technology Project system.
      This Department reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been
      being updated, as necessary, since April 2008.

      Additional information is contained within the Department of Education, OCIO-01,
      Handbook for Information Assurance Cybersecurity Policy.

      SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.

      Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain
      areas of the LINCS Technology Project system. User access is controlled by the
      completion and submission of LINCS Technology Project System Rules of Behavior
      and New User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are
      completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user
      requires access changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns
      the proper permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before
      the initial account is created. Finally, the system administrator implements
      the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The security
      staff and the support contractor review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer
      in use are removed from the system by the system administrator.

      The LINCS Technology Project has implemented user account procedures to disable
      inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The LINCS support staff
      monitors all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3,
      Authentication Management, of the LINCS SSP illustrates the exact procedures
      the contractor support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

      The LINCS Technology Project system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.

      The LINCS Technology Project ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling
      access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted
      in Section 1.1.1 of the LINCS SSP. The technical support staff ensures that
      access to security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized
      personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each instance.
      Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless
      explicitly permitted.

      A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system
      know that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that
      attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution.
      The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed
      a U.S. Government computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable
      by fines or imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use
      notification message before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification
      banner will remain on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to
      log on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on
      all Department instances:

      "You are accessing a U.S. Federal Government computer system intended to be
      solely accessed by individual users expressly authorized to access the system
      by the U.S. Department of Education. Usage may be monitored, recorded, and/or
      subject to audit. For security purposes and in order to ensure that the system
      remains available to all expressly authorized users, the U.S. Department of
      Education monitors the system to identify unauthorized users. Anyone using this
      system expressly consents to such monitoring and recording. Unauthorized use
      of this information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties.
      Except as expressly authorized by the U.S. Department of Education, unauthorized
      attempts to access, obtain, upload, modify, change, and/or delete information
      on this system are strictly prohibited and are subject to criminal prosecution
      under 18 U.S.C § 1030, and other applicable statutes, which may result in fines
      and imprisonment. For purposes of this system, unauthorized access includes,
      but is not limited to:

      • Any access by an employee or agent of a commercial entity, or other third
      party, who is not the individual user, for purposes of commercial advantage
      or private financial gain (regardless of whether the commercial entity or third
      party is providing a service to an authorized user of the system); and

      • Any access in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of
      the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State.

      If system monitoring reveals information indicating possible criminal activity,
      such evidence may be provided to law enforcement personnel."

      The Department of Education grants certain LINCS support staff members the authority
      to post publicly accessible content. These individuals must complete LINCS system
      security training before being granted access to the LINCS and before they can
      post publicly accessible content within the LINCS. Furthermore, each authorized
      individual must follow the procedures delineated within the “Using Drupal” Instruction
      to ensure they are following a verifiable procedure throughout the entire process.
      This covers the LINCS Discussion Lists administration areas, LINCS Quarterly
      Reporting and training tools, and Drupal Content Management systems. Public
