    This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the
    Agency common control catalog.

    Access control policy and procedures are documented in the LINCS SSP. Access to LINCS
    Technology Project operational information or system resources is limited to only
    authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access control
    policies to protect the integrity of the LINCS Technology Project system. This
    Department reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated,
    as necessary, since April 2008.

    Additional information is contained within the Department of Education, OCIO-01,
    Handbook for Information Assurance Cybersecurity Policy.

    SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.
    
    Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain
    areas of the LINCS Technology Project system. User access is controlled by the
    completion and submission of LINCS Technology Project System Rules of Behavior and New
    User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are completed and
    submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access
    changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper
    permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial
    account is created. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights
    according to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support
    contractor review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from
    the system by the system administrator.

    The LINCS Technology Project has implemented user account procedures to disable
    inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The LINCS support staff monitors
    all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication
    Management, of the LINCS SSP illustrates the exact procedures the contractor support
    staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

    The LINCS Technology Project system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.

    The LINCS Technology Project ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling
    access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted in
    Section 1.1.1 of the LINCS SSP. The technical support staff ensures that access to
    security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized
    personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each
    instance. Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless
    explicitly permitted.

    A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system know
    that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that attempts to
    illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution. The warning message
    displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed a U.S. Government
    computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable by fines or
    imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use notification message
    before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification banner will remain
    on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to log on to the device. The
    following is the notification banner displayed on all Department instances:

    "You are accessing a U.S. Federal Government computer system intended to be solely
    accessed by individual users expressly authorized to access the system by the
    U.S. Department of Education. Usage may be monitored, recorded, and/or subject to
    audit. For security purposes and in order to ensure that the system remains available
    to all expressly authorized users, the U.S. Department of Education monitors the
    system to identify unauthorized users. Anyone using this system expressly consents to
    such monitoring and recording. Unauthorized use of this information system is
    prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties. Except as expressly authorized
    by the U.S. Department of Education, unauthorized attempts to access, obtain, upload,
    modify, change, and/or delete information on this system are strictly prohibited and
    are subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C § 1030, and other applicable
    statutes, which may result in fines and imprisonment. For purposes of this system,
    unauthorized access includes, but is not limited to:

    • Any access by an employee or agent of a commercial entity, or other third party, who
    is not the individual user, for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial
    gain (regardless of whether the commercial entity or third party is providing a
    service to an authorized user of the system); and

    • Any access in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the
    Constitution or laws of the United States or any State.

    If system monitoring reveals information indicating possible criminal activity, such
    evidence may be provided to law enforcement personnel."

    The Department of Education grants certain LINCS support staff members the authority

    security training before being granted access to the LINCS and before they can post
    publicly accessible content within the LINCS. Furthermore, each authorized individual
    must follow the procedures delineated within the “Using Drupal” Instruction to ensure
    they are following a verifiable procedure throughout the entire process. This covers
    the LINCS Discussion Lists administration areas, Wiki.lincs.ed.gov, LINCS Quarterly
    Reporting and training tools, and Drupal Content Management systems. Public content is
    only edited via the Drupal Content Management System. All other content is only
