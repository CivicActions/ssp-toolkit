    The LINCS Technology Project complies with the Department of Education Handbook for
    Software Management and Acquisition Policy and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
    policies and procedures. The Department of Education, Office of the Chief Information
    Officer, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy, Information Assurance
    Program (Handbook OCIO-01) states that security requirements will be included in
    information system acquisition contracts based on an assessment of risk in accordance
    with FISMA requirements. The LINCS Technology Project will identify new
    threats/vulnerabilities and technologies that may require updating of solicitation
    documents.

    This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained from
    the Agency common control catalog.

    The LINCS System Owner is responsible for leading the annual budgeting process and
    for tracking organizational spending. The System Owner coordinates with the
    CivicActions Project Manager and CivicActions Security on at least monthly basis to
    track security priorities and spending patterns and determine financial
    requirements. The System Owner also coordinates the approval process for interim
    increases to the security budget, if required. This data is used to support the
    development of the annual budget.

    Security costs are included in either a specific Exhibit 300 or Exhibit 53 in order to
    provide adequate business case information for budget purposes. Security costs are
    represented across the life cycle in the business case (Exhibit 300) for major
    investments and (Exhibit 53) for non-major projects. Security costs are summarized and
    listed as a line item on the Exhibit 53 in the budget submitted to Treasury. Costs for
    providing security at the infrastructure level are contained in the business cases for
    infrastructure supporting computing platforms, desktop processing, the network
    environment, and web capability. Since the Exhibit 300 includes projections for
    multiple fiscal years, its intention is to identify and anticipate security resources
    required.

    The LINCS Technology Project draws from the Department of Education, Office of the
    Chief Information Officer, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy,
    Information Assurance Program (Handbook OCIO-01), Department of Education Lifecycle
    Management (LCM) Framework, NIST SP 800-64, the LINCS Enterprise Performance Life
    Cycle (EPLC) and Agile software development methodology to ensure security
    requirements are incorporated during each phase of the life cycle. This helps to
    ensure the development of secure systems and effective risk management.

    The LINCS Technology Project follows the guidelines and procedures within the
    overarching Department of Education policy documents for all federal acquisition of
    information technology equipment, software and services, Federal Acquisition
    Regulations (FAR) Part 39, “Acquisition of Information Technology.”  Security
    requirements/specifications are included in information system acquisition
    contracts. The requirements in the information system acquisition contract permit
    updating security controls as new threat/vulnerabilities are identified and new
    technologies are implemented.

    The LINCS System and Services Acquisition Policy contains the process for determining
    acceptance criteria for all LINCS system software and services.

    The LINCS organization reviews and approves all acquisition contracts in accordance
    with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
    standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs.

    CivicActions/LINCS and AWS describes this control as “not applicable”, as PIV
    credentials are not applicable to the LINCS system. Access and Authentication
    requirements for the LINCS system for internal CivicActions and customer are
    implemented under access management and enforcement (AC-2 and AC-3) and identification
    and authentication for all users (IA-2 and IA-8).

    It is the responsibiility of LINCS for implementation of PIV capability for
    authentication as required.

    The Department maintains adequate documentation for the LINCS Technology Project
    system. The LINCS Technology Project system documentation is protected as required and
    made available to authorized personnel. Procedures for protecting system documentation
    include management in the private CivicActions Git repository and the publicly
    available documentation trees for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The
    documentation maintained for the LINCS Technology Project system includes:
      
    • System Security Plan (SSP) – this document
    
    • Configuration documentation
    
    • Incident Response and Contingency Plans

    LINCS does not have any dedicated interconnections between information system
    components within the authorization boundary and external third-party vendor
    information systems for the purposes of storing, processing, or transmitting federal
    agency data.

    LINCS is hosted on the AWS Cloud platform, which was approved under the FedRAMP
    Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013.
