      The LINCS Technology Project complies with the Department of Education Handbook
      for Software Management and Acquisition Policy and Federal Acquisition Regulation
      (FAR) policies and procedures. The Department of Education, Office of the Chief
      Information Officer, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy, Information
      Assurance Program (Handbook OCIO-01) states that security requirements will
      be included in information system acquisition contracts based on an assessment
      of risk in accordance with FISMA requirements. The LINCS Technology Project
      will identify new threats/vulnerabilities and technologies that may require
      updating of solicitation documents.

      This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained
      from the Agency common control catalog.

      The LINCS System Owner is responsible for leading the annual budgeting process
      and for tracking organizational spending. The System Owner coordinates with
      the CivicActions Project Manager and CivicActions Security on at least monthly
      basis to track security priorities and spending patterns and determine financial
      requirements. The System Owner also coordinates the approval process for interim
      increases to the security budget, if required. This data is used to support
      the development of the annual budget.

      Security costs are included in Exhibit 53 in the Department's on-line electronic
      Capital Planning and Investment Control system (eCPIC) in order to provide adequate
      business case information for budget purposes. Security costs are represented
      across the life cycle in the business case (Exhibit 300) for major investments
      and (Exhibit 53) for non-major projects - LINCS is a non-major project. Security
      costs are summarized and listed as a line item on the Exhibit 53 in the budget
      submitted to Treasury.

      Costs for providing security at the infrastructure level are contained in the
      business cases for infrastructure supporting computing platforms, desktop processing,
      the network environment, and web capability. Since the Exhibit 53 includes projections
      for multiple fiscal years, its intention is to identify and anticipate security
      resources required.

      The LINCS Technology Project draws from the Department of Education, Office
      of the Chief Information Officer, Handbook for Information Assurance Security
      Policy, Information Assurance Program (Handbook OCIO-01), Department of Education
      Lifecycle Management (LCM) Framework, NIST SP 800-64, the LINCS Enterprise Performance
      Life Cycle (EPLC) and Agile software development methodology to ensure security
      requirements are incorporated during each phase of the life cycle. This helps
      to ensure the development of secure systems and effective risk management.

      The LINCS Technology Project follows the guidelines and procedures within the
      overarching Department of Education policy documents for all federal acquisition
      of information technology equipment, software and services, Federal Acquisition
      Regulations (FAR) Part 39, “Acquisition of Information Technology.”  Security
      requirements/specifications are included in information system acquisition contracts.
      The requirements in the information system acquisition contract permit updating
      security controls as new threat/vulnerabilities are identified and new technologies
      are implemented.

      The LINCS System and Services Acquisition Policy contains the process for determining
      acceptance criteria for all LINCS system software and services.

      The LINCS organization reviews and approves all acquisition contracts in accordance
      with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
      standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs.

      LINCS does not have any dedicated interconnections between information system
      components within the authorization boundary and external third-party vendor
      information systems for the purposes of storing, processing, or transmitting
      federal agency data.

      LINCS is hosted on the AWS Cloud platform, which was approved under the FedRAMP
      Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated 1 May 2013.
