      This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained

      The LINCS Technology Project maintains an Incident Response Plan (IRP), consistent
      with Department of Education Directives and NIST 800-61, which addresses purpose,
      scope, roles, and responsibilities. The incident response procedures address
      any activity or occurrence that compromises the integrity of a system, denies
      access to or use of IT resources, and compromises the sensitivity of the information
      stored in, processed by or transmitted by a system.

      Additionally, the IRP includes procedures to respond to waste, fraud, misuse,
      or abuse of any departmental IT system, damage or loss of software or data contained
      in any system, Use of unlicensed (pirated) software products, discovery of hardware
      or software vulnerabilities

      The LINCS Incident Response Plan can be found in the CivicActions Github repository
      at <https://git.civicactions.net/lincs/compliance/blob/master/docs/security-irp.md>

      Additional information is contained within the Department of Education, Handbook
      for Information Assurance Security Policy (Handbook OCIO-01) and the Department
      of Education, Handbook for Information Security Incident Response and Reporting
      Procedures (Handbook OCIO-14).

      CivicActions Operations and users of the LINCS system with incident response
      responsibilities are required to participate in incident response training once
      the role is assumed within 10 days, as required by LINCS changes, and annually.
      The Incident Response Plan (<https://git.civicactions.net/lincs/compliance/blob/master/docs/security-irp.md>)
      is the basis for the training and the incident response workflow created by
      the Security team.  Upon a review of past incidents, the training is updated
      to ensure processes and workflows are updated.

      The LINCS Technology Project’s Computer Security Officer (CSO) handles all incidents
      for the LINCS Technology Project. The CSO is prepared to report all incidents
      to The Department Computer Incident Response Capability (EDCIRC) and United
      States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) as necessary.

      The LINCS Technology Project utilizes proven incident handling methodologies
      for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment,
      eradication, and recovery. The Department maintains a list of lessons learned
      from ongoing incident handling activities and uses those lessons to update the
      incident response procedures accordingly.

      Preparation activities includes all CivicActions and LINCS internal users are
      trained if their role includes incident response. Detection monitoring tools
      providing notification to incident response personnel for analysis and action.
      Containment, eradication and recovery activities include AWS and LAMP-stack
      inherited fixes and LINCS system administrators adjusting IP port blocking security
      groups and SELinux policies.

      The LINCS Technology project utilizes network and host-based intrusion detection
      systems, monitoring the system and application logs for anomalous events.  Incidents
      are tracked using the same ticketing system that is used to track all system-related
      changes and events.

      The LINCS Incident Response Plan (<https://git.civicactions.net/lincs/compliance/blob/master/docs/security-irp.md>)
      includes a comprehensive incident response program, which details the implementation
      of procedures and tools required for incident handling. The incident response
      program details the roles and responsibilities of LINCS/CivicActions IR Team.
      The IR Team includes members from CivicActions Security and Operations teams.  Incident
      response plays a pivotal role in monitoring, detecting and handling security
      incidents of the entire information system. The IRP details categorization of
      incidents in accordance with NIST 800-61 and accordingly documents and reports
      incidents. The IRP is reviewed annually and updated as needed by ISSO, with
      the assistance of the incident response team.
