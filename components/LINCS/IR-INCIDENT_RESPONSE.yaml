    Handbook for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents
    will be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to
    the LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating the Incident Response
    Plan Policy and Procedures annually. The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for
    approving Incident Response Plan.  All procedures are consistent with requirements of
    FISMA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, applicable executive orders, directives, policies,
    regulations, standards, and guidance. These policies and procedures are applicable to
    the CivicActions staff administering the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    All CivicActions users of the HDG system with incident response responsibilities
    are required to participate in incident response training once the role is assumed
    within 10 days, as required by HDG changes, and annually. The Incident Response
    Plan (<https://github.com/NuCivic/healthdata/wiki/incident-response-plan>) is the basis
    for the training and the incident response workflow created by the Security team.
    Upon a review of past incidents, the training is updated to ensure processes and
    workflows are updated.

    DKAN/HDG Incident Response Plan
    (<https://github.com/NuCivic/healthdata/wiki/incident-response-plan>), includes a
    comprehensive incident response program, which details the implementation of
    procedures and tools required for incident handling. The incident response program
    details the roles and responsibilities of CivicActions IR Team. The IR Team includes
    members from Security, Engineering, and Drupal Engineering teams.  Incident
    response plays a pivotal role in monitoring, detecting and handling security incidents
    of the entire information system. The IRP details categorization of incidents in
    accordance with NIST 800-61 and accordingly documents and reports incidents. The IRP
    is reviewed annually and updated as needed by ISSO, with the assistance of the
    incident response team.
