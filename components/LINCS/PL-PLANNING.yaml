      This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained
      from the Agency common control catalog.

      The LINCS Technology Project developed its security policy planning and procedures
      based on the Department of Education, Office of the Chief Information Officer,
      Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy, Information Assurance Program
      (Handbook OCIO-01), guidance from NIST, the Office of Management and Budget
      and industry best practices. Security policies and procedures are formally documented
      within the LINCS SSP, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains
      to security planning. It provides guidance on all aspects of security for the
      protection of LINCS information technology resources. It defines responsibilities
      for the implementation and oversight of the guidance contained herein. The plan
      was last updated in December, 2015.

      The System Security Plan (SSP) was developed and implemented for LINCS Technology
      Project system in accordance with the Department of Education, Office of the
      Chief Information Officer, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy,
      Information Assurance Program (Handbook OCIO-01), Department of Education Information
      Technology Security, Handbook for Information Technology Security, Certification
      and Accreditation Procedures (Handbook OCIO-05), NIST SP 800-18 and NIST SP
      800-37. The SSP includes a description of the management, operational, and technical
      controls in place or planned for the application. The SSP is included as a key
      document in an application’s C&A package and is reviewed and approved by designated
      officials. The SSP identifies the system owner and responsible parties for managing
      system access and the overall security of the system. The Chief Information
      Security Officer reviews and approves the SSP.  The SSP will be reviewed at
      least annually and updated to account for any changes to the LINCS system and
      to address any changes in security controls.
