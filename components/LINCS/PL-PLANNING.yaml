    CivicActions has developed the system security plan (SSP) for the LINCS system and
    compliant to NIST 800-53 and FIPS 199. The SSP defines the security categorization,
    system boundary, and security requirements and controls meeting NIST requirements
    as required by LINCS. Specifically the SSP:

    1. Is consistent with the organizationâ€™s enterprise architecture

    2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system

    3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions
    and business processes

    4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting
    rationale

    5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships
    with or connections to other information systems

    6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system

    7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable

    8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements
    including a rationale for the tailoring decisions

    9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative
    prior to plan implementation
