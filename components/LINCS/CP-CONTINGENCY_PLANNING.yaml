    The LINCS Technology Project has developed a contingency planning policy consistent
    with Department of Education, Handbook for Information Technology Security Contingency
    Planning Procedures (Handbook OCIO-10) and NIST 800-34. Contingency planning
    procedures are formally documented within the LINCS Technology Project Contingency
    Plan, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to contingency
    planning. The Department reviews and updates the policy as necessary and the policy
    was last updated in July 2012.
