      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained

      The LINCS Technology Project has developed a contingency planning policy consistent
      with Department of Education, Handbook for Information Technology Security Contingency
      Planning Procedures (Handbook OCIO-10) and NIST 800-34. Contingency planning
      procedures are formally documented within the LINCS Technology Project Contingency
      Plan, which provides the roles and responsibilities as it pertains to contingency
      planning. The Department reviews and updates the policy as necessary and the
      policy was last updated in July 2012.
