    The Department of Education developed, documented and disseminated
    to personnel a system and information integrity policy that addresses purpose,
    scope, roles, responsibilities, management committment, coordination among organizational
    entities, and compliance, and developed, documented and disseminated to personnel
    procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.The
    policy is stated in the Office of the Secretary Information Security Policy dated
    July 17, 2013 and the procedures are defined in the Office of the Secretary Procedures
    Handbook for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents
    will be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to
    the LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating
    the System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures annually. The Chief
    Operating Officer is responsible for approving System and Information Integrity.
    All procedures are consistent with requirements of FISMA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001,
    applicable executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
    guidance. These policies and procedures are applicable to the CivicActions staff
    administering the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    Identification of LINCS security flaws are detected as early as possible by the
    following methods:

    • The CivicActions LINCS system environment uses the OWASP ZAP open-source web application
    security scanner to report on needed updates based on known flaws. The CivicActions
    Open Data Team performs the scans on a monthly basis. A report created from the
    OWASP ZAP scanner lists vulnerabilities and ranks them per severity.

    • Service flaw notifications are received by the CivicActions Open Data team.

    Any security issues found are ticketed through the Github ticketing tool. The
    CivicActions Open Data team prioritizes the high findings within Drupal.
    Changes made to correct the LINCS system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled
    and coordinated through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals
    required from the CCB as implemented in CM-3.

    The OWASP ZAP open-source web application security scanner is used to perform
    monthly vulnerability scans of all LINCS system components and assess web application
    interfaces to identify any performance or security issues/flaws. Vulnerabilities
    and findings identified are handled and remediated in accordance with the implementation
    of RA-5. Reports are generated to the CivicActions Open Data team for review,
    analysis, and remediation.

    The LINCS system does not shut down in the event of an integrity violation is discovered.
    If an integrity violation is found, CivicActions conducts frequent backups of
    the LINCS system to support rollback of the LINCS system.
