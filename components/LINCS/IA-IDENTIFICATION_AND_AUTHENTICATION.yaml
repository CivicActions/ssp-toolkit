      The LINCS Technology Project complies with identification and authentication
      policies contained within the Department of Education, Handbook for Information
      Assurance Security Policy (Handbook OCIO-01).

      The LINCS system owners/managers manage user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying
      each user; (ii) verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization
      to issue a user identifier from an appropriate official; (iv) ensuring that
      the user identifier is issued to the intended party; (v) disabling user identifier
      after a reasonable period of inactivity as documented in its security procedures;
      and (vi) archiving user identifiers. The Department reviews and updates this
      policy as necessary.

      The LINCS Technology Project system uniquely identifies and authenticates all
      privileged and program users. This is accomplished through the use of unique
      user identification and a secret user password. All user IDs are maintained
      in a database by the system administrator and no identical IDs may be issued.

      Password requirements are listed under security control IA-5.

      The LINCS Technology Project system does not process sensitive information,
      thus it does not employ multifactor authentication.

      Access to system services - SSH for GNU/Linux instances, RDP for Windows - is
      managed by a set of firewall rules on the systems. The network firewall is configured
      to only allow users to connect to these services from a configured and audited
      IP address.

      Authentication for LINCS internal personnel are created during the personnel
      assignment process where requests are made to the LINCS admin group for proper
      access levels. The LINCS admin group verifies the identity of the user. The
      website performs further verification by sending an email to the user's mailbox
      containing a single-use activation link which must be used to log in to the
      account for the first time and to create a password.

      When entering a user account password upon initial login to lincs.ed.gov, all
      users must comply with the following password policies, which are enforced by
      the website's software configuration:

      • Password must be at least 14 characters in length.

      • Password must contain at least one digit.

      • Password must contain at least one special character (not whitespace or an
      alphanumeric).

      • Password must contain at least one uppercase character.

      • Password must contain at least one lowercase character.

      LINCS is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts,
      which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the
      website's software configuration, as described in IA-5(d).

      In accordance with LINCS site configuration, the following administrative procedures
      exist for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged authenticators,
      and for revoking authenticators.

      • Initial authenticator distribution: Users receive a one-time login link by
      email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log in and
      then must enter a password themselves which complies with the password complexity
      requirements described in IA-4(b).

      • Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators: Users who have forgotten their password
      may request a new password by submitting their username or email address. The
      website responds by emailing a one-time login link to the user's email address.
      After using the link to log in, the user is required to enter a new password.

      • Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in the
      last 90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators may block any user account
      if they believe there is a reason to do so.

      LINCS enforces password lifetime restrictions.  The password lifetime settings for internal accounts is as follows:
      • Minimum restriction of zero (1) days and
      • Maximum restriction of ninety (90) days before a password change is required.

      All non-organization users must follow procedures for access privileges as described
      in AC-2. Any non-organizational user must receive written permission from a
      Department representative to access the LINCS. In addition, only temporary access
      of a specified duration is allowed for non-organizational users directly accessing
      the system. Once the time period is over or the task completed, the temporary
      user accounts are removed immediately.
