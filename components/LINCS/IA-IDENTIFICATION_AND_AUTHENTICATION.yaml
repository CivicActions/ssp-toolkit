    The LINCS Technology Project complies with identification and authentication policies
    contained within the Department of Education, Handbook for Information Assurance
    Security Policy (Handbook OCIO-01).
    
    The LINCS system owners/managers manage user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying
    each user; (ii) verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization to
    issue a user identifier from an appropriate official; (iv) ensuring that the user
    identifier is issued to the intended party; (v) disabling user identifier after a
    reasonable period of inactivity as documented in its security procedures; and (vi)
    archiving user identifiers. The Department reviews and updates this policy as
    necessary.

    The LINCS Technology Project system uniquely identifies and authenticates all
    privileged and program users. This is accomplished through the use of unique user
    identification and a secret user password. All user IDs are maintained in a database
    by the system administrator and no identical IDs may be issued.
    
    Password requirements are listed under security control IA-5.

    The LINCS Technology Project system does not process sensitive information, thus it
    does not employ multifactor authentication.

    Access to system services - SSH for GNU/Linux instances, RDP for Windows - is managed
    by a set of firewall rules on the systems. The network firewall is configured to only
    allow users to connect to these services from a configured and audited IP addres.

    Authentication for LINCS internal personnel are created during the personnel
    assignment process where requests are made to the LINCS admin group for proper access
    levels. The LINCS admin group verifies the identity of the user. The website performs
    further verification by sending an email to the user's mailbox containing a single-use
    activation link which must be used to log in to the account for the first time
    and to create a password.

    When entering a user account password upon initial login to lincs.ed.gov, all users
    must comply with the following password policies, which are enforced by the website's
    software configuration:

    • Password must be at least 14 characters in length.

    • Password must contain at least one digit.

    • Password must contain at least one special character (not whitespace or an
    alphanumeric).

    • Password must contain at least one uppercase character.

    • Password must contain at least one lowercase character.

    LINCS is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts,
    which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the website's
    software configuration, as described in IA-5(d).

    In accordance with LINCS site configuration, the following administrative procedures
    exist for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised/damaged
    authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.

    • Initial authenticator distribution: Users receive a one-time login link by email
    upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log in and then must enter
    a password themselves which complies with the password complexity requirements
    described in IA-4(b).

    • Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators: Users who have forgotten their password may
    request a new password by submitting their username or email address. The website
    responds by emailing a one-time login link to the user's email address. After using
    the link to log in, the user is required to enter a new password.

    • Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in the last 90
    days are automatically blocked. Administrators and Site Managers may block any user
    account if they believe there is a reason to do so.
