    The Department of Health and Human Service developed, documented and disseminated
    to personnel an identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose,
    scope, roles, responsibilities, management committment, coordination among organizational
    entities, and compliance, and developed, documented and disseminated to personnel
    procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.The
    policy is stated in the Office of the Secretary Information Security Policy dated
    July 17, 2013 and the procedures are defined in the Office of the Secretary Procedures
    Handbook for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents
    will be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to
    the LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating
    Identification and Authentication Policy and Procedures annually. The Chief Operating
    Officer is responsible for approving Identification and Authentication. All procedures
    are consistent with requirements of FISMA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, applicable executive
    orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. These policies
    and procedures are applicable to the CivicActions staff administering the lincs.ed.gov
    information system.

    LINCS Access: Site Managers and End Users

    • Site Manager access to web-accessible components of lincs.ed.gov is limited.
    Full access to web-accessible components is only available to CivicActions
    administrators.
    
    • End Users, typically members of the public, have read-only access to view
    and download data resources published on lincs.ed.gov and do not need or receive
    user accounts. End users are also allowed to submit website feedback, but all
    submitted feedback is moderated by an LINCS Site Manager before it is published.

    Once the initial Site Manager accounts are created for LINCS, they subsequently are
    responsible for assigning accounts and privileges to other customer users in their
    organization.

    Identifiers for devices that access the system use the same username, email address
    and password protocol as the identifiers provided to human users of the system
    and undergo the same process of review by the HDG admin group. The HDG admin group
    is responsible for assigning a unique username that identifies the device as well
    as an email address that can be used for account verification.

    All user accounts are required to change their passwords every 90 days. The website

    Authentication for HDG internal personnel are created during the personnel
    assignment process where requests are made to the HDG admin group for proper access
    levels.  The HDG admin group verifies the identity of the user. The website performs
    further verification by sending an email to the user's mailbox containing a single-use
    activation link which must be used to log in to the account for the first time
    and to create a password.

    Prior to issuing initial Drupal Site Manager (highest level of Client User Account)
    system credentials (user ID and initial password),  the CivicActions Implementation
    staff verifies the user’s request for access, typically during the initial kick-off
    call when all stakeholders are present. New Site Managers are able to provide
    additional Site Manager access at their own discretion, and are ultimately responsible
    for managing their own Site Manager and other user accounts that they create.

    Initial authenticator content (a unique email address – not previously used in
    any other account) is provided by the customer. CivicActions Implementation staff
    use that email address to provide the new user with Admin access. Before the Admin
    has access, they are required to create their own passwords; however, the passwords
    Admins choose must conform to the password criteria defined:

    • Enforce password history = 24

    • Minimum password length = 15

    When entering a user account password upon initial login to lincs.ed.gov, all
    users must comply with the following strict password policies, which are enforced
    by the website's software configuration:

    • Password must contain at least one punctuation (not whitespace or an alphanumeric)
    character.

    • Password must contain at least one uppercase character.

    • Password must contain at least one lowercase character.

    • Password must be at least 15 characters in length.

    LINCS Site Managers have the ability to add additional Site Managers to their account.
    The Site Manager needs only a unique email address to do so. All password requirements
    are set at the account level, and will apply to all user accounts. Password requirements
    are not editable for Site Managers.

    Disabling the access of Site Managers to lincs.ed.gov is the responsibility of LINCS.

    HDG is responsible for provisioning and de-provisioning end user accounts,
    which must comply with the strict password policies that are enforced by the website's
    software configuration, as described above

    In accordance with lincs.ed.gov site configuration, the following implementation
    administrative procedures exist for initial authenticator distribution, for
    lost/compromised/damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.

    • Initial authenticator distribution:  Users receive a one-time login link by
    email upon creating of their user account. They use that link to log in and then
    must enter a password themselves which complies with the password complexity requirements
    described in IA-4(b).

    • Lost/compromised/damaged authenticators:  Users who have forgotten their password
    may request a new password by submitting their username or email address. The
    website responds by emailing a one-time login link to the user's email address.
    After using the link to log in, the user is required to enter a new password.

    • Revoking authenticators: Users who have not changed their password in the last
    90 days are automatically blocked. Administrators and Site Managers may block
    any user account if they believe there is a reason to do so.

    restrictions.  The password lifetime settings for internal accounts is as follows:

    • Minimum restriction of zero (0) days and

    but does not prohibit reuse of the 24 previous passwords. Enforcement of the 24
    previous password restriction will be implemented by the end of 2016.
