      The Department follows the risk assessment policy and procedures formally documented
      within in the Department of Education Handbook for Information Technology Security
      Risk Assessment Procedures (Handbook OCIO-07). Furthermore, a Risk Assessment
      Plan was originally initiated to determine the extent of the potential threat
      and the risk associated with LINCS Technology Project throughout its System
      Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The LINCS Technology Project Risk Assessment
      defines the methodology approach to determine the likelihood risks, and identify
      potential mitigation options to reduce risks to the LINCS Technology Project
      system.

      The LINCS Technology Project Risk Assessment will be conducted in accordance
      with the Department’s risk assessment policy and procedures. By doing so, the
      responsible parties associated with the LINCS Technology Project will be able
      to determine the risk, likelihood and impact that could result from exploiting
      vulnerabilities within the system.

      This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained
      from the Agency common control catalog.

      Additional information is contained within the Department of Education Handbook
      for Information Technology Security Risk Assessment Procedures (Handbook OCIO-07).

      In accordance with FIPS 199 requirement and guidelines provided in NIST SP800-60
      Rev.1, the organization categorized the system as a Low system: Confidentiality
      (Low), Integrity (Low), Availability (Low).

      The security categorization was determined by evaluating the type of information
      that is stored, processed, and/or transmitted by the application and the potential
      impact levels associated with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
      of that information. The application’s security categorization has been documented
      in this SSP.

      The security categorizations have been reviewed by the designated application
      POCs, were approved during the C&A effort. The formal security categorization
      document is available upon request. The system inventory for the LINCS Technology
      Project is revalidated semiannually.

      CivicActions/LINCS will perform risk assessments for the LINCS system based
      on SP 800-30 Rev. 1 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments at least annually
      and as part of the change management activities for the LINCS system that warrant
      a new or updated risk assessment.

      The results of risk assessments will be compiled into a risk assessment report
      to be reviewed by CivicActions Security and relevant personnel, and also added
      to the GitLab system for the LINCS system.

      Risk assessments are conducted annually or whenever there are significant changes
      to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification
      of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the
      security state of the system, as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37
      Revision 1.

      A significant change includes:

      • Changing authentication or access control implementations;

      • Changing storage implementations;

      • Changing a COTS product to another product;

      • Changing the backup mechanisms and process; and,

      • Adding new interconnections to an outside service provide.

      The LINCS Technology Project uses vulnerability scanning software to document
      and determine risks to the system.  These scans are being run on a regular basis
      and the results of these scans are being used to inform changes to the system
      and verify that security controls are working correctly.  These scans are used
      to document the current state of the system, and to analyze security trends
      as changes are made over time.
