    The Department follows the risk assessment policy and procedures formally documented
    within in the Department of Education Handbook for Information Technology Security
    Risk Assessment Procedures (Handbook OCIO-07). Furthermore, a Risk Assessment Plan was
    originally initiated to determine the extent of the potential threat and the risk
    associated with LINCS Technology Project throughout its System Development Life Cycle
    (SDLC). The LINCS Technology Project Risk Assessment defines the methodology approach
    to determine the likelihood risks, and identify potential mitigation options to reduce
    risks to the LINCS Technology Project system.

    The LINCS Technology Project Risk Assessment will be conducted in accordance with the
    Department’s risk assessment policy and procedures. By doing so, the responsible
    parties associated with the LINCS Technology Project will be able to determine the
    risk, likelihood and impact that could result from exploiting vulnerabilities within
    the system.

    This is Agency common control.  More data about implementation can be obtained from
    the Agency common control catalog.

    Additional information is contained within the Department of Education Handbook for
    Information Technology Security Risk Assessment Procedures (Handbook OCIO-07).

    In accordance with FIPS 199 requirement and guidelines provided in NIST SP800-60
    Rev.1, the organization categorized the system as a Low system: Confidentiality

    The security categorization was determined by evaluating the type of information that
    is stored, processed, and/or transmitted by the application and the potential impact
    levels associated with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that
    information. The application’s security categorization has been documented in this
    SSP.

    is available upon request. The system inventory for the LINCS Technology Project is
    revalidated semiannually.

    CivicActions/LINCS will perform risk assessments for the LINCS system based on SP
    800-30 Rev. 1 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments at least annually and as part of
    the change management activities for the LINCS system that warrant a new or updated
    risk assessment.

    Risk assessments are conducted annually or whenever there are significant changes
    to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification
    of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security
    state of the system, as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1.

    A significant change includes:

    • Changing authentication or access control implementations;

    • Changing storage implementations;

    • Changing a COTS product to another product;

    • Changing the backup mechanisms and process; and,

    • Adding new interconnections to an outside service provide.

    The LINCS Technology Project uses vulnerability scanning software to document and
    determine risks to the system.  These scans are being run on a regular basis and the
    results of these scans are being used to inform changes to the system and verify that
    security controls are working correctly.  These scans are used to document the current
    state of the system, and to analyze security trends as changes are made over time.
