    The Department of Health and Human Service developed, documented and disseminated
    to personnel a risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
    management committment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance,
    and developed, documented and disseminated to personnel procedures to facilitate
    the implementation of the policy and associated controls.The policy is stated
    in the Office of the Secretary Information Security Policy dated July 17, 2013
    and the procedures are defined in the Office of the Secretary Procedures Handbook
    for Information Security, Version 1.1 dated July 30, 2014. These documents will
    be reviewed periodically. These policies and procedures are applicable to the
    LINCS personnel using the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for reviewing and updating the Risk Assessment
    Policy and Procedures annually. The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for
    approving Risk Assessment.  All procedures are consistent with requirements of
    FISMA, applicable executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
    and guidance. These policies and procedures are applicable to the CivicActions
    staff administering the lincs.ed.gov information system.

    In accordance with FIPS 199 requirement and guidelines provided in NIST SP800-60
    Rev.1, the organization categorized the system as a Low system: Confidentiality
    (Low), Integrity (Low), Availability (Low). This categorization was accepted by
    the Authorizing Official.

    CivicActions will perform risk assessments for the HDG system based on SP 800-30
    Rev. 1 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments at least annually and part of the
    change management activities for the HDG system that warrant a new or updated
    risk assessment. The results of risk assessments will be compiled into a risk
    assessment report to be reviewed by CivicActions Management and relevant personnel,
    and also added to the GitHub system for the HDG system.

    Risk assessments are conducted annually or whenever there are significant changes
    to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification
    of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security
    state of the system, as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1,
    Appendix F.

    A significant change includes:

    • Changing authentication or access control implementations;

    • Changing storage implementations;

    • Changing a COTS product to another product;

    • Changing the backup mechanisms and process; and,

    • Adding new interconnections to an outside service provide.

    In addition to the fully inherited IaaS and PaaS scanning conducted by AWS ACE as
    reported to FedRAMP, the CivicActions Security team uses the OWASP ZAP application
    scanning tool to scan the HDG application for vulnerabilities on a monthly basis.  All
    vulnerability findings are documented for remediation though the CivicActions Security
    team by creating a GitHub issue and assigning the ticket to the appropriate
    CivicActions team. Vulnerability assessments will be archived and be tracked on a
    quarterly Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) and submitted to LINCS personnel
    responsible for the HDG system.

    Results of the vulnerability scans and security assessments are shared with all
    appropriate CivicActions personnel and appropriate LINCS personnel supporting continuous
    monitoring requirements. CivicActions Security team assigns each vulnerability an
    impact rating and response time though the GitHub issue tool for tracking to the
    established remediation deadlines listed in RA-5(d).
