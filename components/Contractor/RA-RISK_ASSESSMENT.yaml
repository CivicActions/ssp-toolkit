      CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to
      personnel a risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
      responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
      entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation
      of the policy and associated controls. This information is maintained in
      the CivicActions Risk Assessment (RA) Policy and Procedure
      that can be found in the CivicActions GitHub repository at
      <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.

      CivicActions Operations uses vulnerability scanning software
      to document and determine risks to the system. Operating system and
      application vulnerability scans include:


      - The CivicActions system environment employs the OpenSCAP scanner with the Red Hat STIG baseline to check for vulnerabilities.

      - The CivicActions application environment is tested by the penetration tester OWASP ZAP, an open-source web application security scanner to report on needed updates based on known flaws.


      CivicActions Operations has automated the process to perform
      the scans on a monthly basis. The resulting reports list vulnerabilities
      and rank them by severity. These reports are stored in Amazon S3 buckets
      and are used to inform changes to the system and verify that security
      controls are working correctly. These scans are used to document the
      current state of the system, and to analyze security trends as changes
      are made over time.

      CivicActions employs the automated vulnerability scanning tools
      OpenSCAP and OWASP ZAP which are interoperable with standard web browsers, the
      Open Source Ansible infrastructure provisioning system and other Open
      Source tools.

      The CivicActions Security Office reviews all vulnerabilities
      identified from automated scans and security assessments. Vulnerabilities
      found and deemed legitimate are assigned an impact rating and response
      time thought creation of an issue or ticket. The CivicActions
      Operations staff reviews current scans and compare with older scans to
      identify trends and to verify previous vulnerabilities have been mitigated.

      Identified and reported vulnerabilities are assigned an impact rating and
      response time by CivicActions' Security and must be
      remediated according to the following time requirements:


      - Critical - Within 15 days of discovery (usually within 1 week))

      - High - Within 30 days of discovery (usually within 1 week))

      - Moderate - Within 90 days of discovery (usually within 2 weeks)

      - Low - Within 180 days of discovery

      Results of the vulnerability scans and security assessments are shared
      with all appropriate CivicActions personnel supporting
      continuous monitoring requirements. CivicActions Security
      assigns each vulnerability an impact rating and response time through
      JIRA or the Git issue tool for tracking to the established remediation
      deadlines listed in RA-5(d).
