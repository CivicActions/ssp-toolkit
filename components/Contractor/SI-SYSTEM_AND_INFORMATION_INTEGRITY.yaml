      CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to
      personnel a system and information integrity policy that addresses
      purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
      coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures
      to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.
      This information is maintained in the CivicActions System
      and Information Integrity (SI) Policy document that can be found in the
      CivicActions GitHub repository at
      <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.

      Identification of information system security flaws are detected as early
      as possible by the following methods:


      - Vulnerability scans, as described in RA-5.

      - Log analysis from monitoring described in SI-4.

      - Service flaw notifications (CVEs, etc.) are received by the
        CivicActions Security Office and passed on to
        CivicActions Operations staff when relevant.

      Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA and/or the Git issue
      queue. CivicActions Operations staff prioritizes high
      findings. Changes made to correct the information system as a result of
      the system flaws are scheduled and coordinated through the CCB Change
      Request Process and appropriate approvals required from the CCB as
      implemented in CM-3.

      CivicActions testing of the system as a result of security
      flaw remediation is done through a development environment through the
      use of internal software and automated testing that ensures the system is
      working as intended. When a change is made by a developer, testing though
      a peer review is conducted as part of the Change Request process to ensure
      the correct analysis is completed. Then the changed code is tested in an
      automatic test environment as described in the Configuration Management
      Plan (CMP). Tracking of the testing is documented in JIRA and/or the Git
      issue queue.

      CivicActions security-software updates are tested prior to
      implementation on production. The CivicActions Security
      framework for installation requires updates to be made within 30 days for
      high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities, and 240 for
      low vulnerabilities. An issue ticket is created to track any updates made
      to the system.

      Virus scans are performed by ClamAV, a server-hosted tool protecting the
      application from Trojans, Viruses and other malicious cyber-threats.
      Real-time scans are conducted whenever files are uploaded from any
      external source and malicious code is blocked or quarantined when detected.
      All file-based traffic traversing the server is sanitized before being
      delivered. All input form text is validated and sanitized.

      CivicActions systems use a collection of monitoring systems,
      including:


      - ClamAV - provides signature-based malware detection/quarantine

      - OSSEC host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)

      - AIDE Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (IDS))

      - fail2ban, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) framework

      - SELinux - a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) IPS

      - auditd - a secure system audit daemon

      - CloudWatch - AWS monitoring and measurement system

      - StatusCake - website monitoring tool

      - OpsGenie - a slack/email/text/phone incident escalation tool

      enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible
      sources of information.
