      CivicActions system administrators employ a personal public-key pair for basic
      access and must originate from a whitelisted IP address. The whitelist is maintained
      by an Ansible inventory file, the current complete list (includes dev sites) of
      users with whitelisted IPs is in artifact: ia-2-inventory-whitelist.txt

      To access root (sudo) privileges an additional password is required. The passwords
      are maintained in encrypted form in the Ansible inventory file. The mechanism
      to enable select users to use a password to obtain root access can be viewed

    text: CivicActions systems employ authentication methods consistent with NIST
      FIPS 140-2 requirements. General public access to system web pages does not
      require cryptographic authentication. Privileged users accessing systems use
      the public-key cryptographic functionality of Secure Shell (SSH) to encrypt
      the exchange of information (including the password) between the remote user
      and the server. Where Transport Layer Security (TLS, aka SSL) is used, cryptographic
      modules will be configured in accordance with FIPS 140-2.
