      CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to
      personnel a certification, accreditation, and security assessment policy
      that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
      and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and
      associated controls. This information is maintained in the
      CivicActions Security Assessment and Authorization Policy.
      This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance
      Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.

      CivicActions will develop a security assessment plan (SAP)
      that describes the security controls and control enhancements under
      assessment, assessment procedures used to determine effectiveness, the
      assessment environment, the assessment team, and the assessment roles and
      responsibilities.
  - key: b

      CivicActions will assess the security controls in their
      system and its environment of operation to determine the extent to which
      the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
      producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security
      requirements.

      All controls assigned and documented in this System Security Plan (SSP)
      will be tested at least annually or when there is a major change to the
      system.

      CivicActions will produce a security assessment report that
      documents the results of the assessment. The Security Assessment Report
      must contain the results of the assessment, and may also contain
      recommendations and suggestions for plans of actions and milestones
      (POA&Ms).

      CivicActions will provide the results of the security control
      assessment to the System Owner, Project Manager, CivicActions
      Security, and the Authorization Official (AO)). The security control
      assessment package includes the following:

      * Security Control Matrix

      * Privacy Impact Assessment

      * E-Authentication

      * Contingency Plan

      * Configuration Management Plan

      * Rules of Behavior

      CivicActions documents all deficiencies and vulnerabilities
      identified during the security certification and/or continuous monitoring
      phase (via security assessment, vulnerability scanning, risk assessment,
      etc.) within the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).

      The POA&M document provides a platform for CivicActions to
      monitor and track the deficiency and its mitigation strategy. POA&M items
      will include:

      * The description of the deficiency,

      * Dedicated point of contact for this deficiency.

      * Cost of the mitigation strategy

      * Associated risk and NIST control

      * Recommended mitigation strategy

      POA&Ms are tracked throughout the lifecycle of the system until its
      mitigation. All POA&Ms are reviewed on a monthly basis by
      CivicActions Information System Security Officer to ensure
      all mitigation strategies are continuing as documented.

      CivicActions implements a continuous monitoring strategy
      that incorporates configuration management, system scanning and log
      analysis processes:

      * Configuration management includes the assessment of security impact
        analyses of proposed and implemented changes.

      * System scanning is managed by running the OpanSCAP vulnerability scanner
        using the DISA STIG profile.

      * Log analysis is managed by feeding logs to a Graylog dashboard for analysis.

  - key: b
    text: >
      Configuration management and log analysis is carried out in real-time.
      OpenSCAP security scans are performed and reviewed monthly. See also:
      RA-5 and SI-4.

      Quarterly review of the control assessments supporting the monitoring is
      conducted by CivicActions Operations in collaboration with the
      CivicActions Security Office.

      CivicActions Security reviews the results of the security
      scans and security assessments with associated JIRA and/or GitLab Issue
      tickets created to correlate and analyze security-related information
      generated from the monitoring tools becoming POA&M items for tracking.
  - key: f

      POA&M items are tracked by CivicActions Security through
      JIRA tickets with a security categorization assigned.  The information
      included in the POA&M item include the severity, the due date, the
      weakness source identifier, and the plugin ID that identified the
      vulnerability.
