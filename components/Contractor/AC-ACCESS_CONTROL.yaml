      of all accounts issued to internal admin roles supporting the information system.

      request and the CivicActions Operation staff manages the entire account creation
      process.

      All accounts issued for application administrators and SSH are documented
      in CivicActions' ticketing system. Account request tickets contain details that
      explain the attributes for the account including authorized users of Drupal,
      system infrastructure, group and role membership, and access authorizations.

      In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC-01) Policy when an
      account is no longer required, the Project Manager notifies the Operations Team
      to immediately disable all access. Users upon reassignment, change in roles,
      termination, or leaving employment are initially removed from all roles and
      groups, effectively denying them all access to privileged accounts.
