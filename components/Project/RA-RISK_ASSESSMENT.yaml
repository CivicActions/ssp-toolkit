      The Client follows the risk assessment policy and
      procedures formally documented within None.
      Furthermore, a Risk Assessment Plan was originally initiated to determine
      the extent of the potential threat and the risk associated with
      Project throughout its System Development Life Cycle
      (SDLC). The Project Risk Assessment defines the methodology
      approach to determine the likelihood risks, and identify potential
      mitigation options to reduce risks to the Project system.


      The Project Risk Assessment will be conducted in accordance
      with the Department’s risk assessment policy and procedures. By doing so,
      the responsible parties associated with the Project will
      be able to determine the risk, likelihood and impact that could result
      from exploiting vulnerabilities within the system.


      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be
      obtained from the Agency common control catalog.

      In accordance with FIPS 199 requirement and guidelines provided in NIST
      SP800-60 Rev.1, the organization categorized the system as a Low system:
      Confidentiality (Low), Integrity (Low), Availability (Low).
  - key: b

      The security categorization was determined by evaluating the type of
      information that is stored, processed, and/or transmitted by the
      application and the potential impact levels associated with the
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information. The
      application’s security categorization has been documented in this SSP.

      The security categorizations have been reviewed by the designated
      application POCs, were approved during the C&A effort. The formal security
      categorization document is available upon request. The system inventory
      for the Project Project is revalidated semiannually.

      Risk assessments are conducted annually or whenever there are significant
      changes to the information system or environment of operation (including
      the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other
      conditions that may impact the security state of the system, as defined
      in NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1.

      A significant change includes:


      - Changing authentication or access control implementations;

      - Changing storage implementations;

      - Changing a COTS product to another product;

      - Changing the backup mechanisms and process; and,

      - Adding new interconnections to an outside service provide.

      The Project uses vulnerability scanning software to document and
      determine risks to the system. These scans are run monthly and the results of
      these scans are being used to inform changes to the system and verify that security
      controls are working correctly. These scans are used to document the current state
      of the system, and to analyze security trends as changes are made over time.
