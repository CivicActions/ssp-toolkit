      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be
      obtained from the Agency common control catalog.


      Access control policy and procedures are documented in the
      The Project SSP. Access to Project operational
      information or system resources is limited to only authorized users,
      programs or processes. The Department enforces access control policies
      to protect the integrity of the The Project. This Department reviews
      and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated, as
      necessary, since April 2008.

      SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.


      Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access
      certain areas of the Project system. User access is
      controlled by the completion and submission of Project
      system Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user
      and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever a new
      user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The
      system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper
      permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the
      initial account is created. Finally, the system administrator implements
      the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The
      security staff and the support contractor review accounts periodically.
      Accounts no longer in use are removed from the system by the system
      administrator.


      The Project has implemented user account procedures to
      disable inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The
      Project support staff monitors all user accounts to ensure
      this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication Management, of
      the Project SSP illustrates the exact procedures the
      contractor support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

      The Project system does not have guest or anonymous
      accounts.

      is authorized by the appropriate manager.

      noted in Section 1.1.1 of the Project SSP. The technical

      A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to
      the system know that the system and its information are “Authorized User
      Only” and that attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to
      criminal prosecution. The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized
      users that they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and
      continued, unauthorized use can be punishable by fines or imprisonment.
      Each device logged into will display a system use notification message
      before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification banner
      will remain on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to log
      on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on
      all system instances:


      "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
      provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any
      device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:


      - The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

      - At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

      - Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

      - This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or privacy.

      - Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."
