      The Project documents the security policy and procedures
      in addressing position categorization, personnel screening, personnel
      termination, personnel transfer, and access agreements within the
      Project SSP. Project adopts the
      Client personnel security standards and determines
      position risks levels based on public trust responsibilities.

  narrative:
  - text: >
      Project position sensitivity levels are assigned by the
      Client Full Name. Each position designation is documented on the
      Standard Position Description (SPD) and assigned a risk level (or
      sensitivity level) commensurate with the sensitivity of the information,
      the risk to that information and the system maintaining that information.
      The levels of risk still need to be designated by
      Client for employee and contractor positions but
      since Project system does not have any sensitive data,
      a low risk scenario can be assumed.


      - Employee risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= LBI, High Risk= BI.

      - Contractor risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= NACC, High Risk= BI.


      In order to ensure every employee is assigned to a position, which has
      been reviewed for sensitivity by the NCC, the SPD is a required data
      attribute of an employee’s HR record. Position risks designations are
      reviewed and revised when NCC or OPM publish changes to sensitivity
      levels.

      Minimum background investigations are conducted, since all data is
      non-sensitive, for individuals requiring access to Project
      information and information systems. The type of background investigation
      conducted for an individual is determined by the individual’s position
      risk categorization noted in control PS-2. Client
      conducts periodic reinvestigations in accordance with OPM and NIST
      guidelines.

      Client Full Name HR policy states that managers or designated
      officials are responsible for recovering and properly securing employee
      badges and returning it to the local physical security office. The
      Client executes termination procedures that remove
      personnel access privileges, computer accounts. When an employee is
      terminated, the employee’s manager or designated official completes a
      form requesting termination of access for the user. Local management and
      the security manager coordinate disabling or removing Project
      privileged access with the system administrator. The employee’s manager
      or designated official is responsible for recovering and properly
      securing his/her ID badge and returning it to the local physical security
      office. The employee’s manager or designated official ensures that any
      information on the system that the employee was responsible for will be
      available to the appropriate personnel.

      When an employee is reassigned or transferred, the employee’s manager or
      designated official is required to request transfer of access (as
      appropriate) for the user.


      In accordance with the Client Full Name HR policy, the employee’s
      manager or designated official is responsible for recovering and properly
      securing his/her ID badge and returning it to the local physical security
      office. The manager provides prompt notification to the
      Project system/security administrator when an employee
      changes assignments and/or location. This includes taking prompt and
      appropriate action to change employee access profile and/or remove
      employee from the system; and ensure that users’ system access is
      cancelled when the need no longer exists.
