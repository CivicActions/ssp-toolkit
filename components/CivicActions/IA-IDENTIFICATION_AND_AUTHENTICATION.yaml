    User accounts are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a unique username,

    in AC-2.

    In accordance with CivicActions Identification and Authentication (IA) Policy
    <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/blob/master/IA-Policy.md>,
    CivicActions internal users are uniquely identified by creation of an organizational
    account with a username based on each user's first and last names.

    All user accounts are required to change their passwords every 90 days. The website
    will automatically block the accounts of users who fail to change their password
    within that time period, after which the account may only be unblocked by a website
    Administrator or CivicActions Operations.

    CivicActions users are required to take appropriate measures in the handling of
    passwords including:

    • Not transmitting user names and passwords together in an unencrypted format

    • Not permitting the sending of passwords in an unencrypted format via email

    • Not listing passwords in tickets

    • Not writing down or storing passwords in a readable form in any physical or
    logical location where they may be discoverable by unauthorized persons.

    CivicActions systems employ authentication methods consistent with NIST FIPS 140-2
    requirements. General public access to system web pages does not require cryptographic
    authentication. Privileged users accessing systems use the public-key cryptographic
    functionality of Secure Shell (SSH) to encrypt the exchange of information (including
    the password) between the remote user and the server. Where Transport Layer Security
    (TLS, aka SSL) is used, cryptographic modules will be configured in accordance with
    FIPS 140-2.
