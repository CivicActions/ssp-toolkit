    CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a certification,
    accreditation, and security assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
    responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
    and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy
    and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Security
    Assessment and Authorization Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions
    Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.

    CivicActions will assess the security controls in their system and its environment of
    operation to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting
    established security requirements,
    
    All controls assigned and documented in this System Security Plan (SSP) will be tested
    at least annually or when there is a major change to the system.

    CivicActions documents all deficiencies and vulnerabilities identified during
    the security certification and/or continuous monitoring phase (via security assessment,
    vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, etc.) within the Plan of Action and Milestones
    (POA&M).

    The POA&M document provides a platform for CivicActions to monitor and track the
    deficiency and its mitigation strategy. POA&M items will include:

    • The description of the deficiency,

    • Dedicated point of contact for this deficiency.

    • Cost of the mitigation strategy

    • Associated risk and NIST control

    • Recommended mitigation strategy

    POA&Ms are tracked throughout the lifecycle of the system until its mitigation.
    All POA&Ms are reviewed on a monthly basis by CivicActions Information System
    Security Officer to ensure all mitigation strategies are continuing as documented.

    CivicActions implements a continuous monitoring strategy that incorporates
    configuration management, system scanning and log analysis processes:

    • Configuration management includes the assessment of security impact analyses of
      proposed and implemented changes.

    • System scanning is managed by running the OpanSCAP vulnerability scanner using the
      DISA STIG profile.

    • Log analysis is managed by feeding logs to a Graylog dashboard for analysis.
