    CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a certification,
    accreditation, and security assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
    responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
    and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy
    and associated controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions Security
    Assessment and Authorization Policy. This document can be found in the CivicActions

    CivicActions documents all deficiencies and vulnerabilities identified during
    the security certification and/or continuous monitoring phase (via security assessment,
    vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, etc.) within the Plan of Action and Milestones
    (POA&M).

    The POA&M document provides a platform for CivicActions to monitor and track the
    deficiency and its mitigation strategy. POA&M items will include:

    • The description of the deficiency,

    • Dedicated point of contact for this deficiency.

    • Cost of the mitigation strategy

    • Associated risk and NIST control

    • Recommended mitigation strategy

    POA&Ms are tracked throughout the lifecycle of the system until its mitigation.
    All POA&Ms are reviewed on a monthly basis by CivicActions Information System
    Security Officer to ensure all mitigation strategies are continuing as documented.
