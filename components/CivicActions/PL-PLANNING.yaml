    CivicActions has developed this system security plan (SSP) for the information system
    as part of compliance with NIST 800-53 and FIPS 199. The SSP defines the security
    categorization, system boundary, and security requirements and controls meeting the
    requirements of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). Specifically the SSP:

    1. Is consistent with the organizationâ€™s enterprise architecture

    2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system

    3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions
    and business processes

    4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting
    rationale

    5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships
    with or connections to other information systems

    6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system

    7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable

    8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements
    including a rationale for the tailoring decisions

    9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative
    prior to plan implementation
