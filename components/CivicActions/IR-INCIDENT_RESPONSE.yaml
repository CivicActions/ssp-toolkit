    All CivicActions employees with incident response responsibilities are required to
    participate in incident response training once the role is assumed within 10 days, as
    required by HDG changes, and annually. The CivicActions Incident Response Plan
    (<https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan>)
    is the basis for the training and the incident response workflow created by the
    Security team.  Upon a review of past incidents, the training is updated to ensure
    processes and workflows are updated.

    The CivicActions Engineering and Security teams conduct a post-incident analysis to
    assist in documenting lessons learned and suggesting changes to improve the incident
    response process. Tickets created in response to the incident event are reviewed upon
    completion by Engineering and Security teams. Updates considered requiring changes to

    CivicActions utilizes the JIRA ticketing tool for tracking and reporting of incident
    events from reporting to resolution and post-incident analysis. Initial reporting can
    come from continuous monitoring tools as well as client and public submissions made to
    support@civicactions.com. Jira processes the tickets for the public submissions and
    CivicActions' Support Team creates associated GitHub Issues. Internal incidents
    reported are processed within the GitHub Issue queue. Details of the handling
    procedures are included in the CivicActions Response Plan
    (<https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan>),

    CivicActions Incident Response Plan
    (<https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan>),
    includes a comprehensive incident response program, which details the implementation
    of procedures and tools required for incident handling. The incident response program
    details the roles and responsibilities of CivicActions IR Team. The IR Team includes
    members from Security, Engineering, and Drupal Engineering teams.  Incident response
    plays a pivotal role in monitoring, detecting and handling security incidents of the
    entire information system. The IRP details categorization of incidents in accordance
    with NIST 800-61 and accordingly documents and reports incidents. The IRP is reviewed
    annually and updated as needed by ISSO, with the assistance of the incident response
    team.
