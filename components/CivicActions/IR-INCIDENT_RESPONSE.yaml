    events from reporting to resolution and post-incident analysis. Initial reporting can
    come from continuous monitoring tools as well as client and public submissions made to

    reported are processed within the GitHub Issue queue. Details of the handling
    procedures are included in the CivicActions Incident Response Plan
    (<https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan/#response-process>) Response Process.
