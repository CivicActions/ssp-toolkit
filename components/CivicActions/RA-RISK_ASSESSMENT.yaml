    CivicActions Operations uses vulnerability scanning software to document and determine
    risks to the system.  These scans are being run on a regular basis and the results of
    these scans are being used to inform changes to the system and verify that security
    controls are working correctly.  These scans are used to document the current state of
    the system, and to analyze security trends as changes are made over time.

    Operations reviews current scans and compare with older scans to identify trends and
    to verify previous vulnerabilities have been mitigated.
