    CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a risk assessment
    policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
    coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to
    facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls. This information
    is maintained in the CivicActions Risk Assessment (RA) Policy and Procedure
    CivicActions that can be found in the CivicActions Github repository at
    <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.

    CivicActions Operations uses vulnerability scanning software to document and determine
    risks to the system. Operating system and application vulnerability scans include:

    • The CivicActions system environment employs the OpenSCAP scsnner with the DISA STIB
    baseline to check for vulnerabilities. CivicActions Operations has automated the
    process to perform the scans on a monthly basis. A report created from the OpenSCAP
    scanner lists vulnerabilities and ranks them per severity.

    • The CivicActions applicate environment is tested by the penetration tester OWASP
    ZAP, an open-source web application security scanner to report on needed updates based
    on known flaws. CivicActions Operations has automated the process to perform the scans
    on a monthly basis. A report created from the OWASP ZAP scanner lists vulnerabilities
    and ranks them per severity.

    These scans are being run on a regular basis and the results of these scans are being
    used to inform changes to the system and verify that security controls are working
    correctly.  These scans are used to document the current state of the system, and to
    analyze security trends as changes are made over time.

    CivicActions uses the automated vulnerability scanning tools OpenSCAP and OWASP ZAP to
    scan systems and applications. Both tools update the list of known vulnerabilities
    automatically and describes the risk of each vulnerability.

    CivicActions Security reviews all vulnerabilities identified from automated scans and
    security assessments.  Vulnerabilities found and deemed legitimate are assigned an
    impact rating and response time thought creation of an issue or ticket.  CivicActions
    Operations reviews current scans and compare with older scans to identify trends and
    to verify previous vulnerabilities have been mitigated.

    Identified and reported vulnerabilities are assigned an impact rating and response
    time by CivicActions Security and must be remediated according to the following time
    requirements:
    
    • High - Within 30 days of discovery
    
    • Moderate - Within 90 days of discovery
    
    • Low - Within 240 days of discovery

    Results of the vulnerability scans and security assessments are shared with all
    appropriate CivicActions personnel supporting continuous monitoring
    requirements. CivicActions Security assigns each vulnerability an impact rating and
    response time though JIRA or the Git issue tool for tracking to the established
    remediation deadlines listed in RA-5(d).
