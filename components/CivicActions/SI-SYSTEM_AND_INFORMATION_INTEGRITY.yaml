      CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a system
      and information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
      management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
      and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated
      controls. This information is maintained in the CivicActions System and Information
      Integrity (SI) Policy document that can be found in the CivicActions Github
      repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/>.

      Identification of information system security flaws are detected as early as
      possible by the following methods:

      • Vulnerability scans, as described in RA-5.

      • Log analysis from monitoring described in SI-4.

      • Service flaw notifications (CVEs, etc.) are received by CivicActions Security
      and passed on to CicvicActions Operations when relevant.

      Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA and/or the Git issue queue.
      CivicActions Operations prioritizes the high findings.  Changes made to correct
      the information system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled and coordinated
      through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals required from
      the CCB as implemented in CM-3.

      CivicActions testing of the system as a result of security flaw remediation
      are done through a development environment though use of internal software and
      automated testing that ensures the system is working as intended. When a change
      is made by a developer, testing though a peer review is conducted as part of
      the Change Request process to ensure the correct analysis is completed. Then
      changed code is tested in an automatic test environment as described in Configuration
      Management Plan (CMP). Tracking of the testing is documented in JIRA and/or
      the Git issue queue.

      CivicActions security-software updates are tested prior to place to production.
      The CivicActions Security framework for installation requires updates to be
      made within 30 days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities,
      and 240 for low vulnerabilities. An issue ticket is created to track the any
      updates made to the system.

      Per implementation of CM-3, any changes to the source code of the system requires
      the CCB Change Request process. A peer review as part of the Change Request
      process is conducted to ensure the requested change is verified prior to entering
