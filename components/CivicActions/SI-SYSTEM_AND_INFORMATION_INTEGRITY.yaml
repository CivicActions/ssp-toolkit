    CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a system and
    information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
    management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.
    This information is maintained in the CivicActions System and Information Integrity
    (SI) Policy document that can be found in the CivicActions Github repository at

    Identification of information system security flaws are detected as early as possible
    by the following methods:

    • Vulnerability scans, as described in RA-5.

    • Log analysis from monitoring described in SI-4.

    • Service flaw notifications (CVEs, etc.) are received by CivicActions Security and
    passed on to CicvicActions Operations when relevant.

    Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA and/or the Git issue queue.
    CivicActions Operations prioritizes the high findings.  Changes made to correct the
    information system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled and coordinated
    through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals required from the CCB
    as implemented in CM-3.

    CivicActions testing of the system as a result of security flaw remediation are done
    through a development environment though use of internal software and automated
    testing that ensures the system is working as intended. When a change is made by a
    developer, testing though a peer review is conducted as part of the Change Request
    process to ensure the correct analysis is completed. Then changed code is tested in an
    automatic test environment as described in Configuration Management Plan (CMP).
    Tracking of the testing is documented in JIRA and/or the Git issue queue.

    days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities, and 240 for low
    vulnerabilities. An issue ticket is created to track the any updates made to the

    The OpenSCAP and OWASP ZAP security scanners are used to perform monthly vulnerability
    scans of all system components and assess web application interfaces to identify any
    performance or security issues/flaws. Vulnerabilities and findings identified are
    handled and remediated in accordance with the implementation of RA-5. Reports are
    generated to CivicActions Security and Operations for review, analysis, and

    Change Request process. A peer review as part of the Change Request process is
    conducted to ensure the requested change is verified prior to entering production.
