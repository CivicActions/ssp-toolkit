    Both regular and ad hoc training to all CivicActions personnel, including those who
    support the system infrastructure and applications, is provided. All employees and
    contractors must complete Security Awareness trainings upon being hired and at least
    annually thereafter. CivicActions Operations will not create accounts for individuals
    until they have successfully completed the trainings. Additional training will be
    provided as required by system changes. Training takes the following forms:

    Annual Knowledge Survey (i.e., Security Awareness Training): All employees are
    required to review trainings covering Security Awareness. After the training, a
    survey-style security awareness test is taken by employees. All CivicActions personnel
    are required to complete and pass the survey, and new employees are required to pass
    before being granted access to the Information System. In order to successfully pass
    the test, a score of 80% is required. This survey tests CivicActions personnelâ€™s
    knowledge of critical security subjects, policies and procedures. Results from this
    survey are compiled by the Director of Human Resources and used to refine future
    training efforts.

    Ad Hoc Security Awareness: The CivicActions ISSO oversees the approximately bi-monthly
    distribution of security awareness tips and articles to the all CivicActions
    employees. This can include general tips as well as articles tailored to the specific
    requirements of CivicActions users.
  summary: Initial security awareness training provided to all staff.
