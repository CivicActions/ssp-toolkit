    Both regular and ad hoc training to all CivicActions personnel, including those
    who support the system infrastructure and applications, is provided. All employees
    and contractors must complete Security Awareness and Insider Threat trainings
    upon being hired and at least annually thereafter. The CivicActions Help Desk
    will not create accounts for individuals until the Director of Human Resources
    confirms they have successfully completed the trainings. In addition, training
    compliance reports are run on a monthly basis and discussed during monthly meetings
    to ensure training compliance is met for all CivicActions personnel. Additional
    training will be provided as required by system changes. Training takes the following
    forms:

    Annual Knowledge Survey (i.e., Security Awareness and Insider Threat Trainings):
    All employees are required to review trainings covering Security Awareness and
    Insider Threat. After the training, a survey-style security awareness test is
    taken by employees. All CivicActions personnel are required to complete and pass
    the survey, and new employees are required to pass before being granted access
    to the Information System. In order to successfully pass the test, a score of
    80% is required. This survey tests CivicActions personnel’s knowledge of critical
    security subjects, policies and procedures. Results from this survey are compiled
    by the Director of Human Resources and used to refine future training efforts.

    Ad Hoc Security Awareness: The CivicActions ISSO oversees the approximately
    bi-monthly distribution of security awareness tips and articles to the all CivicActions
    employees. This can include general tips as well as articles tailored to the specific
    requirements of CivicActions users.

    Refresher Training: A learning management system is used to track training activities
    and to notify personnel when their training has expired and must be refreshed.
    Training must be refreshed at least annually. The Director of Human Resources
    is responsible for ensuring that the trainings are completed.
