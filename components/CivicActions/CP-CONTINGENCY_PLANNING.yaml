    The Contingency Plan documents the mechanisms with supporting procedures that allow
    all system components to be recovered and reconstituted to the systemâ€™s original state
    after a disruption or failure. This original state means that all system parameters
    (either default or organization-established) are reset, patches are reinstalled,
    system and security configuration settings are reestablished, system documentation and
    operating procedures are available, application and system software is reinstalled,
    information from the most recent backups is available and the system is fully tested.
