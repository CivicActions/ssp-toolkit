      System maintenance is done from remote sites as there is no direct access to
      the server instances in the AWS cloud; this is the government-approved method
      of doing business. Approval, QA, and monitoring is conducted by the team performing
      the specific maintenance.

      Remote diagnostic tools, such as OSSEC, AIDE, fail2ban and OpenSCAP are used
      to verify the integrity of files, perform log analysis, monitor login attempts
      and check for root kits and other vulnerabilies.

      All nonlocal maintenance requires the same authentication requirements to perform
      the maintenance activities as to access the system as defined in controls AC-3
      and IA-2. SSH is used to secure all communications between the remote user and
      the components located in the AWS cloud.

      CivicActions records for nonlocal maintenance is managed through JIRA tickets
      and the Git issue queue as well as normal system logs. CivicActions administrator
      activity to the system is also logged though the implementation of the AU-2
      (Audit Events) and AU-3 (Content of Audit Records).

      Maintenance on the system and applications can only be performed by personnel
      designated as having internal administrator privileges and responsibilities.  Access
      rights for the internal administrators are assigned and granted access to perform
      their specific job responsibilities. All physical maintenance requirements are
      inherited from AWS.
