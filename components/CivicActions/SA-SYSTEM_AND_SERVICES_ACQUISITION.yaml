    CivicActions has developed, documented and disseminated to personnel a system and
    services acquisition policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
    management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    procedures to facilitate the implementation of the policy and associated controls.
    This information is maintained the CivicActions System and Services Acquisition (SA)
    Policy document that can be found in the CivicActions Github repository at

    CivicActions' System and Services Acquisition Policy affects all personnel with
    purchasing authorization, and applies to all infrastructure purchases or deployments
    including software (e.g., SaaS, development tools, administration tools, hosting
    providers) or hardware (e.g., laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets,
    servers, and external storage).

    The Acquisition security policy includes a list of questions to be reviewed in
    scoring each information system or service prior to acquisition. This assessment
    evaluates the product based on the vendor’s security practices, policies, and
    past performance. It also details the potential maintenance and end-of-life ramifications
    with regards to security. Questions asked include:

    • Does the product meet any security standards set by independent laboratories,
    such as ISO/IEC?

    • Does the product meet federal government security standards, such as FedRAMP
    or individual FIPS criteria?

    • Does the product support encrypted connections for any online transactions required
    to use the product?

    • Does the software store its data in a secure format?

    Based on responses to the questions, the acquisition is given a security score
    which is then reviewed by CivicActions' Open Data Platform Engineering and Security
    teams prior to purchase.

    The CivicActions ISSO is responsible for determining the requirements for protecting
    security-related documentation that is included in CivicActions acquisition contracts.
    This determination is based on an assessment of risk and in accordance with applicable
    federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards for
    requirements for protecting security-related documentation.  In determining these
    requirements the CivicActions ISSO coordinates with the Development Operations
    Manager, Customer Support Engineering Manager, the Contracts Manager, and if necessary
    the Chief Operating Officer.

    The CivicActions System and Services Acquisition Policy is only accessible to
    authorized roles via the Github repository tool.  Access to Github is role based and
    maintained through the access management and enforcement controls (AC-2 and AC-3).

    Information system security engineering principles are applied in the specification,
    design, development, implementation, and modification of the application system.

    Sound security policy, developing layered protections, and controls have been
    established as the foundation for design throughout the SDLC defined in control
    SA-3. Security requirements are incorporated into that SDLC, as described previously.

    CivicActions uses a development-stage-production testing and management workflow
    as part of the CivicActions development model. Changes are first tested on a development
    environment, then moved to a staging environment for further testing. Once the
    client approves the changes, a backup is made of the production environment, and
    the changes are then deployed. More information regarding this model can be found
    in CM-3 and CM-4.The CivicActions organization ensures that all its developers
    are trained on how to build secure software, that security controls have been
    tailored to meet business and operational needs.

    CivicActions performs configuration management during information system design,
    development, implementation, and operation in accordance with CM-9.  Developers and
    System Administrators working on the LINCS system are required to work within the bounds
    of CivicActions' configuration management process. This defines the process for moving
    any change from lower (i.e. development and test) environments to higher ones
    (i.e. production).

    Configuration changes are first tested on a development environment, then moved
    to a staging environment for further testing and client approval. Once the client
    approves the changes, a backup is made of the production environment, and the
    changes are then deployed. This application receives the LINCS’s source code from
    the code repository stored in GitHub, a web storage collaboration site.

    The CivicActions team develops, tests, validates, and documents proposed changes prior
    to implementation to assess the impact to the security and privacy risk posture of the
    system.  Approval for any change as a result of the identifying flaws to the
    system will be processed by CivicActions Security, Open Data Platform Engineering,
    DKAN Product Engineering, and the Open source support engineering teams.

    CivicActions developed in-house code requires a peer review of any change to the
    source code. All change requests are organized into code release tickets in Github,
    which are approved and reviewed by the Change Control Board (CCB) prior to deployment
    to production.
