    CivicActions testing of the system as a result of security flaw remediation are done
    through a development environment though use of internal software and automated
    testing that ensures the system is working as intended. When a change is made by a
    developer, testing though a peer review is conducted as part of the Change Request
    process to ensure the correct analysis is completed. Tracking of the testing is
    documented in the Github ticketing tool.

    CivicActions security-software updates are tested prior to place to production.  The
    CivicActions Security team framework for installation requires updates to be made
    within 30 days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities, and 240
    for low vulnerabilities.  An issue ticket is created to track the any updates made to
    the system.

    Flaw remediation is part of the CivicActions configuration management process.  Any
    security issues found are ticketed through the Github ticketing tool. The CivicActions
    Security team prioritizes the high findings within the Drupal application. Changes
    made to correct the system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled and
    coordinated through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals required
    from the CCB Chair as implemented in CM-3.
