    • Anonymous user – readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not
    logged in.

    Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via unique username/password
    for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions and
    access are provided on "least privilege" principle.

    The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
    does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal
    Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.

    CivicActions implements the policy of least privilege for all logical components
    of Drupal by allowing only authorized access for users, which are necessary to
    accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational
    need.

    At the application layer, Drupal is designed with a role based user access system, a
    least privileged approach based on assignment of privileges to roles. Drupal‘s
    permission systems enables control of what users can do and see on the
    site. CivicActions has defined a specific set of permissions for each of the user
    roles mentioned in control AC-5.

    SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing
    basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are reported
    and reviewed by the CivicActions Data team and evaluated to determine roles that
    need to be revoked.
