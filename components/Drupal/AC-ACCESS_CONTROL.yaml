      Drupal provides user accounts for individuals who participate in visiting, contributing
      to and administering the site with the following roles:

      • Anonymous user – readers of the site who either do not have an account or
      are not logged in.

      • Authenticated user – All non-anonymous users inherit the "authenticated user
      role."

      • Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.

      Access control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via a unique username/password
      for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions,
      and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.

      The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
      does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal
      Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.

      CivicActions implements the policy of least privilege for all logical components
      of Drupal by allowing only authorized access for users, which are necessary
      to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational
      needs.

      At the application layer, Drupal is designed with a role-based user access system,
      a least-privileged approach based on the assignment of privileges to roles.
      Drupal‘s permission systems enable control of what users can do and see on the
      site. CivicActions has defined a specific set of permissions for each of
      the user roles mentioned in control AC-5.

      SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing
      basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are
      reported and reviewed by the CivicActions Data team and evaluated to determine
      roles that need to be revoked.
