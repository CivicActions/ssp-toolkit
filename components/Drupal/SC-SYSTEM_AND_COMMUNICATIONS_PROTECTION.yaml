  narrative: >
    Drupal, when deployed on SELinux in full enforcing mode, minimizes the number of
    services and computing nodes that are exposed to the Internet. Drupal employs both the
    AWS platform safeguards and the Drupal Watchdog module in monitoring and recording
    system events. All other computing nodes used in the system are isolated within AWS.
