      Drupal, when deployed on SELinux in full enforcing mode, minimizes the number
      of services and computing nodes that are exposed to the Internet. Drupal employs
      both the AWS platform safeguards and the Drupal Watchdog module in monitoring
      and recording system events. All other computing nodes used in the system are
      isolated within AWS.
