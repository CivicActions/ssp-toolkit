      Transaction logs are generated by the Apache web server, Drupal CMS, MySQL database
      and PHP page processing.  Specifically, the following server, application, database
      and network device audit log events are captured:

      • Apache access log :: Contains a list of requests for your website that have
      bypassed Varnish. These requests include pages, theme files, and static media
      files.

      • Apache error log :: Records any Apache-level issues. The issues reported here
      are usually caused by general server issues, including capacity problems, .htaccess
      problems, and missing files.

      • Drupal page request log :: Records all Drupal page loads on your website.

      • Drupal watchdog log :: Records Drupal-related actions on your website. The
      watchdog log is recorded on your server if you have enabled the syslog module.

      • MySQL slow query log :: Contains a list of MySQL queries that have taken longer
      than one second to complete.

      • PHP error log :: Records any issues that occur during the PHP processing portion
      of a page load. Issues reported here are usually caused by a website’s code,
      configuration, or content.

      CivicActions has extensive experience and specialization as a host of websites
      that are built using the Drupal web hosting platform. Our list of auditable
      events is also informed by the experience and advice of Drupal's security team,
      which receives security vulnerability reports and publishes security updates
      related to Drupal and the more than 1 million websites that use the Drupal platform.  Should
      the need for additional logging become evident, we have the ability to do so
      by modifying the website's source code to insert additional Drupal watchdog
      hooks.

      The logs collected for Drupal sites include the following types of information:

      • IP number of the request originator

      • Timestamp

      • Request URL

      • HTTP status code returned

      • Username

      • Drupal watchdog message (if applicable)

      • Unique numerical ID of the content being modified (for content creation, modification
      and deletion events)

      When auditing a Drupal incident, CivicActions' developers aggregate log sources
      from multiple servers into the Graylog dashboard so that all log entries for
      a single managed security incident can be analyzed in a single document. Log
      sources are sorted, filtered and reviewed.  Application logs are maintained
      primarily for after-the-fact investigation of critical system or security events.

    The logs collected for Drupal sites include username, event message, timestamp IP of request originator, etc.
