    AWS monitors the use of information systems and
    system accounts. User access events are sent to AWS’s Security Information
    Event Management (SIEM) System. The SIEM is configured to alert on information
    system account events. There is procedure in place for monitoring and review of
    ACE account usage by AWS personnel. AWS’s central logging is internal, not
    customer-facing. This tool is used to audit account usage for items such as failures
    and has the ability to monitor for certain trends. Actions performed by users
    are captured by the system in several logs, including an access log that logs
    all HTTP requests received by the system, a Drupal requests log which records
    all requests processed by the Drupalsoftware, and a Drupal watchdog log, which
    provides additional information about noteworthy events such as user login/logouts.

    CivicActions personnel create user accounts on the AWS Cloud Enterprise
    platform that is used to manage server hosting. AWS user
    accounts are only provided to CivicActions developers who need access to the server
    so they can perform site updates and maintenance. Access to the system
    servers is provided to developers by adding them as members to an "AWS team"
    which allows them to log in to the platform using an AWS user account that
    is managed by AWS. AWS defines the following roles and permissions for members
    of this team:

    • Team lead — Has full access to subscriptions and can invite other members to a team
    and assign roles.

    • Senior Developer — Has full access to all environments of the site (Dev, Stage, and Prod).

    • Developer — Has access only to the Dev and Stage environments, and therefore cannot
    elevate code to Production.
