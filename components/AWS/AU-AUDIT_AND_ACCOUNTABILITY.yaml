    Transaction logs are generated by the AWS Cloud, so this system partially inherits
    this control from the FedRAMP Provisional ATO granted to the AWS Cloud dated
    17 March 2016 for the following:  audit events for the AWS platform. Specifically,
    AWS is responsible for logging the following server, application, database
    and network device audit log events:

    • Apache access log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

    • Apache error log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

    • Drupal page request log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

    • Drupal watchdog log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

    • PHP error log :: standard Drupal logging practices apply

    • MySQL slow query log :: Since slow query logs are stored in a root-only MySQL
    directory on your servers, you can only download them using the Cloud > Logs page,
    and you cannot access them directly on the server. For more information, see
    Downloading your slow query log and Tools for parsing a slow query log.

    • Varnish log :: Notes which requests have been served by Varnish cache and which
    were not. Since most customers use shared load balancers, Varnish logs are only
    available via the Log Streaming feature and cannot be downloaded from either the
    Insight website or your servers.
