      In this architecture, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3 bucket logging, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
      Logging, and Amazon RDS MySQL error logging are employed, which generate audit records that
      include the level of detail specified in the control. CloudTrail logs provide
      information on activities related to the manipulation of the infrastructure; Amazon S3 bucket
      logs provide data on activities related to the access or manipulation of data stored in
      Amazon S3; ELB logs provide information about requests or connections; Amazon RDS Database MySQL
      error logs record errors encountered by the database engine. In addition, the MySQL
      general query log can be enabled by the customer organization to capture when clients
      connect or disconnect and SQL statement received from clients.

      AWS built-in features include customer alerting of CloudTrail and other service
      failures through the AWS Service Health Dashboard (http://status.aws.amazon.com) and
      through optional RSS feeds subscribed to by customers, as well as through email and
      other direct alerts to root account owners for events deemed critical enough for direct
      contact, per AWS internal Incident Response and corporate communications processes.
