      In this architecture, the following audit methods generate records with
      the level of detail specified for the control:


      - **AWS CloudTrail logging**: Provides information on activities
        related to infrastructure changes.

      - **Amazon S3 bucket logging**: Provides data on activities related to the
        access or manipulation of data stored in Amazon S3.

      - **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging**: Provides information about
        requests or connections.

      - **Amazon RDS MySQL error logging**: Captures errors encountered by the
        database engine. In addition, the MySQL general query log can be enabled
        by the customer organization to capture when clients connect or disconnect
        and SQL statements received from clients.

      AWS built-in features include customer alerting of AWS CloudTrail and other
      service failures through the following:


      - AWS Service Health Dashboard (http://status.aws.amazon.com)

      - RSS feeds to which the customer organization can subscribe

      - email

      - alerts sent directly to the AWS account *root user* for critical events

      AWS includes the Amazon Time Sync Service. Running over Network Time
      Protocol (NTP), this service synchronizes the time on AWS instances using
      redundant satellite-connected and atomic clocks in all public AWS regions.
      The Amazon Time Sync Service provides accurate time stamp data to the
      following audit methods:


      - AWS CloudTrail logging

      - Amazon S3 bucket logging

      - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logging

      - Amazon RDS MySQL error logging

      Time stamps are recorded as specified in the ISO 8601 standard. ISO 8601

      Access to audit data and tools is determined by access control policies
      for IAM groups and roles. Only users assigned to IAM groups and roles with
      access to audit data and tools can access them. Additionally, AWS uses
      server-side encryption on Amazon S3 bucket logs, and maintains them as
      read-only files.

      AWS CloudTrail logs are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, which dynamically
      allocates storage capacity to support continuous collection and storage of
      AWS CloudTrail log data. The storage capacity supports indefinite retention,
      but with 7 year retention specified, and migration to Amazon Glacier after
      90 days in AWS regions where Glacier is available.
