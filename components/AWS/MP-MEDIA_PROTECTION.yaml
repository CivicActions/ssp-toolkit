      This Media Protection control associated with hardware components within AWS is
      generally either partially or fully inherited from the AWS physical infrastructure,
      while the customer organization is responsible for any part of the control that is
      applicable to customer-controlled equipment and facilities, and the customer's
      configurable portion of the AWS logical infrastructure, including the Operating systems
      on Amazon EC2 instances and the customer's applications.


      For the U.S. East, U.S. West, and GovCloud regions, this control is inherited from
      pre-existing Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) or JAB provisional Authority to Operate
      under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).


      Refer to the AWS FedRAMP SSP artifacts, including the Control Implementation Summary
      and Customer Responsibility Matrix, available from the AWS Compliance Team. http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/
