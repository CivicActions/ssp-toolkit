      In this architecture, network communications to, from, and between VPCs, subnets and
      Amazon S3 buckets are controlled as follows: AWS Route Tables specify which subnets in each
      VPC are accessible through gateways and which are isolated/private. AWS Security Groups
      provide stateful inbound/outbound port/protocol restrictions, Amazon Simple Storage
      Service (Amazon S3) buckets support access control restrictions based on network
      source/destination.

      In this architecture, subnetworks for publicly accessible system components are
      logically separated from internal private subnetworks via AWS security groups, refined
      routing tables, and NACLs.

      In this architecture, connection to external networks is possible only through Internet
      Gateways (IGWs) or NAT gateways (in regions where supported by AWS VPC) and are
      restricted based on ports/protocols via AWS Security groups, and default subnet rules
      provided by NACLs.

      In this architecture, initial private/public SSH keys stored in Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) are supplied to Amazon EC2 instances upon launch, and the public key portion
      is managed within the AWS Amazon EC2 service. In addition, server-side encryption is
      used for Amazon S3 storage and Amazon RDS databases, using key management provided
      by AWS for the storage buckets and Amazon RDS databases.

      In this architecture, encryption mechanisms are employed for data at rest and in
      transit. For data at rest, AES-256 Server Side encryption is employed for data stored
      in Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS databases. For data in transit, to protect against exposure of any
      cleartext data transmitted deliberately (upload/download) or incidentally during
      interactive systems management operations, Amazon S3 object access can only be
      conducted over encrypted sessions via TLS; the bastion host, Amazon EC2 instances and
      associated security groups are configured for encrypted SSH sessions only. For web
      user access, the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) employs a TLS endpoint.


      AWS built-in features employ TLS for AWS Management Console sessions, AWS API calls,
      and AWS Command Line Interface connections.

      In this architecture, the AMIs that make up the operating systems deployed on Amazon EC2
      instances maintain separate execution domains/address spaces for executing processes
      within the customer operating environment.


      AWS built-in features of the hypervisors that support the infrastructure maintain
      separate execution domains/address spaces for executing processes.
