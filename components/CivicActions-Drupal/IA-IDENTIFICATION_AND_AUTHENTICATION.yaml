    CivicActions users of the system are required to identify and authenticate
    in order to access any functions of the information system beyond viewing and
    downloading the publicly available website content that is available to all anonymous
    website visitors. Users who are assigned to CivicActions require the appropriate
    authorization described in AC-2. CivicActions users authenticate using the standard
    Drupal login protocol prior to using the LINCS services. LINCS user roles are described
    in AC-3.

    To access the website as an authenticated user, front-end users of the application must first
    request and be given a login account with a unique username, password and email
    address. Login accounts can only be created by existing website users with the
    role of either Administrator or Site Manager. Users with those roles also assign
    roles to each login account that govern the user's ability to create, publish,
    update or delete website content such as blog entries, datasets and data resource
    files.

    Upon account creation, the Drupal software assigns each user account a unique
    numerical user ID (uid). This uid is used internally by the system to track user
    actions such as content creation or editing. The numerical user IDs are never
    reused even if their user accounts are subsequently blocked or deleted.

    In accordance with CivicActions Identification and Authentication (IA) Policy
    <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/blob/master/IA-Policy.md>,
    CivicActions internal users are uniquely identified by
    creation of an organizational account with a username based on each user's full
    first and last name.
    
    When Drupal user accounts are created, users' email addresses are verified by sending
    a single-use activation link to the user’s mailbox. The email recipient then uses
    the activation link to log in to the website and supply a password which must
    meet the system's password complexity requirements.

    Refer to control AC-2 in this SSP for further details on account provisioning.

    CivicActions will create and maintain an initial Drupal Administrator (highest level
    of Drupal Account). New Administrators are able to provide additional Administrator
    access at their own discretion, and are ultimately responsible for managing their
    own Administrator and other user accounts that they create.

    CivicActions/Drupal requires users to change their password upon initial login, and the
    application website enforces this. User accounts are assigned a randomly-generated
    and unguessable default password that is not shared with anyone, including site
    Administrators. Once the user logs in and creates a new password, the default
    password erased from the website's database.

    For all Drupal users, passwords are protected by the website's software,
    which only stores an encrypted string based on the password. This means that even
    if the website's database should be compromised, an attacker would still be unable
    to know users' actual passwords. Internal users receive training in security awareness
    and acceptable use and are instructed never to reveal their passwords to anyone.

    • Not transmitting user names and passwords together in an unencrypted format

    • Not permitting the sending of passwords in an unencrypted format via email

    • Not listing passwords in tickets

    • Not writing down or storing passwords in a readable form in any physical or
