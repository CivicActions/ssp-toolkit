    contributing to and administering the site with the following roles:

    • Anonymous user – readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not logged in.

    • Authenticated user – All non-anonymous users inherit the "authenticated user role."

    • Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.

    SSH system accounts are provided to CivicActions Security and Operations staff on

    CivicActions' Operations Manager-Data assigns the “admin” group for the management
    of all accounts issued to HDG admins, DKAN users and other internal admin roles
    supporting the information system. Account requests are initiated by a direct
    manager or supervisor by completing a ticket request and the Operations Manager-Data
    approving the request. The admin user manages the entire account creation process.

    All accounts issued for the admin management of Drupal or SSH access must be approved
    by a direct manager or supervisor who must create an account request. The CivicActions
    security team applies appropriate account permissions and settings based on the
    job role and function documented within the request ticket. The CivicActions security
    team verifies the name of the requestor to ensure account requests have been initiated
    by the appropriate personnel.
    Specific workflow accounts, including author, editor, and approver accounts are
    created by individuals assigned the site manager or administrator role. As a matter
    of application design, business users perform account creation based on their
    business needs.
    System-level maintenance as required is through an installed private-public
    key pair installed to the OS at instance launch.

    In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC) Policy when a CivicActions
    employee's account is no longer required, the employee’s manager notifies the
    security team to immediately disable all access. Users upon reassignment, change
    in roles, termination, or leaving employment are initially removed from all groups,
    effectively denying them all access by the HDG admin group.

    In accordance with the CivicActions Access Control (AC) Policy, access control
    to Drupal is enforced by authentication via unique username/password
    for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions
    and access are provided on "least privilege" principle.

    The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
    does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Administrators
    and Site Managers are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.

    CivicActions implements the policy of least privilege for all logical components
    of Drupal by allowing only authorized access for users, which are necessary to
    accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with business functions and organizational
    need.

    At the application layer, Drupal is designed with a role based user access system,
    a least privileged approach based on assignment of privileges to roles. Drupal‘s
    permission systems enables control of what users can do and see on the site. In
    consultation with LINCS, CivicActions has defined a specific set of permissions
    for each of the user roles mentioned in control AC-5.

    SSH access is provided on a least privilege basis and analyzed on an ongoing
    basis, at least quarterly. Findings related to these audits of accounts are reported
    and reviewed by the CivicActions Data team and evaluated to determine roles that
    need to be revoked.

    CivicActions, at least quarterly, audits all team accounts based on the
    concept of least privilege. Each member of the developer team is assigned a role
    of which defines access needed to perform only the member’s job function.  The
    audit of accounts is reported and reviewed by the HDG admin group and evaluated
    to determine whether roles or membership within the developer team should be changed.
