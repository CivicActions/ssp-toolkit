      Project does not collect PII other than that covered by the "Rolodex exception".
      Anonymous access is possible, but community participation require an account
      for which these fields are required:

      * Email address - used for identification.

      * First name, last name - used for addressing a logged in user.

      Any additional information is entered by the user at will to enhance community
      participation in forums.

      - Identify themselves to the system
      - Authenticate with the system to prove that they are the same person when they return
      - Enable emailed password reset
      - Access control (e.g. updating notification settings, following a moderation of a discussion, etc.)
      - Carry out actions that impact that individual (e.g. joining a course or signing up for a mailing list subscription)
      - Publish information to make it available to others (e.g. forum posting, comment on publications of learning resources, etc.)
