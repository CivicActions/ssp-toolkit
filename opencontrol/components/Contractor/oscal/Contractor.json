CivicActions Agile management continues to improve the software through ongoing planned code releases. The process is overseen by the Change Control Board (CCB) as described in CM-1. Each point release introduces code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:\n\n- Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request project of the CivicActions ticketing system which describes the overall goals of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in the ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release. Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades to newer versions of the software packages that have been used to build the website.\n- Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks. Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which the CCB selects a list of tickets to be implemented. CivicActions Development holds daily coordination meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which issues have been resolved and which need further work.\n- Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate code branch within the CivicActions Git repository, and tested using the GitLab Runner continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on a ticket is completed, the developer creates a merge request, and the changes are submitted to at least one other developer for review to ensure they meet functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull request is merged into the Git repository's development branch for the planned code release.\n- Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and configuration necessary to implement the changes are merged into the website's staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.\n- User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release notes to be shared with the customer.\n- Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production and presented to CivicActions' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.\n- Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately prior to the deployment.\n- Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a security scan using a web vulnerability scanner.\n\n  Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from\na variety of sources:\n- Customer support requests received by the CivicActions Help Desk\n- Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by users\n- Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis of those incidents performed by the CivicActions Security Office and Operations staff\n- Security notifications received by the CivicActions Security Office from external security teams and other software vendors\n- Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by the CivicActions Security Office\n- Issues reported by the CivicActions Security Office, Operations staff and Development\n- Security issues reported through continuous monitoring"
