      The CivicActions Project Manager assigns the "administrator" role for the management
      of all accounts issued to internal admin roles supporting the information system. 
      Account requests are initiated by the Project Manager by completing a ticket
      request and the CivicActions Operation staff manages the account creation process.
    key: b

      Both regular and ad hoc training to all CivicActions personnel, including those
      who support the system infrastructure and applications, is provided. All employees
      and contractors must complete Security Awareness training upon being hired and
      at least annually thereafter. CivicActions Operations staff will not create
      accounts for individuals until they have successfully completed the trainings.
      Additional training will be provided as required by system changes. Training
      takes the following forms:


      Annual Knowledge Survey (i.e., Security Awareness Training): All employees are
      required to review trainings covering Security Awareness. After the training,
      a survey-style security awareness test is taken by employees. All CivicActions
      personnel are required to complete and pass the survey, and new employees are
      required to pass before being granted access to the Information System. In order
      to successfully pass the test, a score of 80% is required. This survey tests
      CivicActions personnel’s knowledge of critical security subjects, policies and
      procedures. Results from this survey are compiled by the Office of Human Resources
      and used to refine future training efforts.


      Ad Hoc Security Awareness: The CivicActions' Security Office oversees the approximately
      bi-monthly distribution of security awareness tips and articles to all CivicActions
      employees. This can include general tips as well as articles tailored to the
      specific requirements of CivicActions users.

      CivicActions Operations uses vulnerability scanning software to document and
      determine risks to the system. Operating system and application vulnerability
      scans include:


      - The CivicActions system environment employs the OpenSCAP scanner with the
      Red Hat STIG baseline to check for vulnerabilities.

      - The CivicActions application environment is tested by the penetration tester
      OWASP ZAP, an open-source web application security scanner to report on needed
      updates based on known flaws.


      CivicActions Operations has automated the process to perform the scans on a
      monthly basis. The resulting reports list vulnerabilities and rank them by severity.
      These reports are stored in Amazon S3 buckets and are used to inform changes
      to the system and verify that security controls are working correctly. These
      scans are used to document the current state of the system, and to analyze security

      The system and application(s) are managed by CivicActions using the Agile software
      development methodology, which provides a continuous System Development Life
      Cycle (SDLC) methodology. CivicActions Agile management continues to improve
      the software through ongoing planned code releases. The process is overseen
      by the Change Control Board (CCB) as described in CM-1. Each point release introduces
      code and configuration changes to the website through the following SDLC methodology:


      - Code release planning: A code release ticket is created in the Change Request
      project of the CivicActions ticketing system which describes the overall goals
      of the code release. The code release ticket is linked to other tickets in the
      ticketing system which describe issues to be addressed by the planned code release.
      Those issues may include bug fixes and feature enhancements as well as upgrades
      to newer versions of the software packages that have been used to build the
      website.

      - Sprints: The tickets covered by the planned code release are then implemented
      through a series of planned sprints, each of which typically lasts two weeks.
      Each sprint begins with a sprint planning session at which the CCB selects a
      list of tickets to be implemented. CivicActions Development holds daily coordination
      meetings throughout the sprint to share information and resolve any problems
      that may be blocking progress toward completion. At the end of the sprint, a
      retrospective is performed in which progress is reviewed to determine which
      issues have been resolved and which need further work.

      - Development/unit testing: Work on each ticket is performed within a separate
      code branch within the CivicActions Git repository, and tested using the GitLab
      Runner continuous integration platform. Developers also write unit tests to
      prove their code behaves as expected and address security considerations such
      as information leakage, bounds checking, and input validation. Once work on
      a ticket is completed, the developer creates a merge request, and the changes
      are submitted to at least one other developer for review to ensure they meet
      functional requirements and address security considerations before the pull
      request is merged into the Git repository's development branch for the planned
      code release.

      - Integration testing: Once all work tickets have been completed, the code and
      configuration necessary to implement the changes are merged into the website's
      staging server, where it undergoes additional testing to ensure there are no
      conflicts between the work that has been done on individual tickets.

      - User acceptance testing (UAT): The code release undergoes manual testing against
      a checklist of expected site behaviors and options each of the website's defined
      user roles to further verify that the functional changes work as expected and
      to identify any changes in user experience that need to be documented in release
      notes to be shared with the customer.

      - Approval for deployment: After all the planned code release has passed all
      of the above tests, the code release is scheduled for deployment to production
      and presented to CivicActions' Change Control Board (CCB) for review and approval.

      - Deployment to production: A full backup of the website is performed immediately
      prior to the deployment.

      - Security scan: After the deployment to production, the website undergoes a
      security scan using a web vulnerability scanner.

        Security issues to be addressed in the planned code release may come from
      a variety of sources:

      - Customer support requests received by the CivicActions Help Desk

      - Security concerns, incidents, and site performance issues reported by users

      - Security incident reports, including server log analysis and root cause analysis
      of those incidents performed by the CivicActions Security Office and Operations
      staff

      - Security notifications received by the CivicActions Security Office from external
      security teams and other software vendors

      - Vulnerabilities detected during security scans of the website performed by
      the CivicActions Security Office

      - Issues reported by the CivicActions Security Office, Operations staff and
      Development

      - Security issues reported through continuous monitoring
    key: a
  - text: >
      The CivicActions organization defines and documents information security roles
      and responsibilities throughout the SDLC. The following teams participate in
      this process:


      - Customer Support: Files tickets when incidents are reported and shares incident
      reports with customers

      - The CivicActions Security Office: Receives security notifications from the
      Drupal security team and other software vendors; performs security scans; uses
      CivicActions JIRA ticketing system to request mitigation of all reported vulnerabilities

      - CivicActions Development: Performs server log analysis when security incidents
      are reported; assists in root cause analysis

      - Change Control Board: Meets weekly to review and approve upcoming planned
      code changes to the website, include security-related code releases.

      - AWS Cloud: Monitors server and application events; proactively respond to
      security incidents, and reports incidents to CivicActions

      - Users: Communicates customer security requirements and expectations, and alerts
      the CivicActions customer support team whenever it detects a security or site
      performance issue


      Security responsibilities performed by these teams include the following:


      - Perform configuration management during information system design, development,
      implementation, and operation;

      - Implement only organization-approved changes;

      - Document approved changes;

      - Manage and control changes to the system;

      - Fully test all changes, taking into account security considerations as well
      as other functional requirements;

      - Track security flaws and flaw resolution; and

      - Employ code analysis tools to examine software for common flaws and document
      the results of the analysis.

      CivicActions security-software updates are tested prior to implementation on
      production. The CivicActions Security framework for installation requires updates
      to be made within 30 days for high vulnerabilities, 90 days for moderate vulnerabilities,
      and 240 for low vulnerabilities. An issue ticket is created to track any updates
      made to the system.

      Flaw remediation is part of the CivicActions configuration management process.
      Any security issues found are ticketed through JIRA or the Git issue queue.
      The CivicActions Security Office prioritizes the high findings within the application.
      Changes made to correct the system as a result of the system flaws are scheduled
      and coordinated through the CCB Change Request Process and appropriate approvals
      required from the CCB Chair as implemented in CM-3.

      Virus scans are performed by ClamAV, a server-hosted tool protecting the application
      from Trojans, Viruses and other malicious cyber-threats. Real-time scans are
      conducted whenever files are uploaded from any external source and malicious
      code is blocked or quarantined when detected. All file-based traffic traversing
      the server is sanitized before being delivered. All input form text is validated
      and sanitized.
