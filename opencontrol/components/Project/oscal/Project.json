The System Owner also coordinates the approval process for interim increases to the security budget, if required. This data is used to support the development of the annual budget.\n\nSecurity costs are included in Exhibit 53 in the Department's on-line electronic Capital Planning and Investment Control system (eCPIC) in order to provide adequate business case information for budget purposes. Security costs are represented across the life cycle in the business case (Exhibit 300) for major investments and (Exhibit 53) for non-major projects - Project is a non-major project. Security costs are summarized and listed as a line item on the Exhibit 53 in the budget submitted to Treasury.\n\nCosts for providing security at the infrastructure level are contained in the business cases for infrastructure supporting computing platforms, desktop processing, the network environment, and web capability. Since the Exhibit 53 includes projections for multiple fiscal years, its intention is to identify and anticipate security resources required."
