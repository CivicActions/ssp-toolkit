      This is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained
      from the Agency common control catalog.


      Access control policy and procedures are documented in the The Project SSP.
      Access to Project operational information or system resources is limited to
      only authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access
      control policies to protect the integrity of the The Project. This Department
      reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated,
      as necessary, since April 2008.

      SSH system accounts are provided to contractors on an as-needed basis.


      Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain
      areas of the Project system. User access is controlled by the completion and
      submission of Project system Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request
      forms by the user and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever
      a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The
      system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions.
      The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial account
      is created. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights according
      to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support contractor
      review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from the
      system by the system administrator.


      The Project has implemented user account procedures to disable inactive user
      accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The Project support staff monitors all
      user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication
      Management, of the Project SSP illustrates the exact procedures the contractor
      support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

      The Project system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.

      A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system
      know that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that
      attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution.
      The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed
      a U.S. Government computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable
      by fines or imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use
      notification message before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification

      log on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on
      all system instances:


      "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided

      including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network
      operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and
      counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

      - At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

      - Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject
      to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used
      for any USG-authorized purpose.

      - This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls)
      to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or privacy.

      - Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM,

      based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific
      security requirements of the Department, PO and the information systems to which
      personnel have authorized access. Annual training requirements may be met by
      completing one or more course(s) within the Department’s learning management

      the sensitivity of the information stored in, processed by or transmitted by
      a system.


      Additionally, the IRP includes procedures to respond to waste, fraud, misuse,
      or abuse of any departmental IT system, damage or loss of software or data contained

      designation is documented on the Standard Position Description (SPD) and assigned
      a risk level (or sensitivity level) commensurate with the sensitivity of the
      information, the risk to that information and the system maintaining that information.
      The levels of risk still need to be designated by Client for employee and contractor
      positions but since Project system does not have any sensitive data, a low risk
      scenario can be assumed.


      - Employee risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate
      Risk= LBI, High Risk= BI.

      - Contractor risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI,
      Moderate Risk= NACC, High Risk= BI.


      In order to ensure every employee is assigned to a position, which has been
      reviewed for sensitivity by the NCC, the SPD is a required data attribute of

      the CivicActions Project Manager and CivicActions Security on at least monthly
      basis to track security priorities and spending patterns and determine financial
      requirements. The System Owner also coordinates the approval process for interim
      increases to the security budget, if required. This data is used to support
      the development of the annual budget.


      Security costs are included in Exhibit 53 in the Department's on-line electronic
      Capital Planning and Investment Control system (eCPIC) in order to provide adequate
      business case information for budget purposes. Security costs are represented
      across the life cycle in the business case (Exhibit 300) for major investments
      and (Exhibit 53) for non-major projects - Project is a non-major project. Security
      costs are summarized and listed as a line item on the Exhibit 53 in the budget
      submitted to Treasury.


      Costs for providing security at the infrastructure level are contained in the
      business cases for infrastructure supporting computing platforms, desktop processing,
      the network environment, and web capability. Since the Exhibit 53 includes projections
      for multiple fiscal years, its intention is to identify and anticipate security
      resources required.

      The Project draws from the None, NIST SP 800-64, and Agile software development
      methodology to ensure security requirements are incorporated during each phase
      of the life cycle. This helps to ensure the development of secure systems and
      effective risk management.

      The Project follows the guidelines and procedures within the overarching None.
      The requirements in the information system acquisition contract permit updating
      security controls as new threat/vulnerabilities are identified and new technologies
      are implemented.


      The Project System and Services Acquisition Policy contains the process for
      determining acceptance criteria for all Project system software and services.


      The Project organization reviews and approves all acquisition contracts in accordance
      with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
      standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs.

      CivicActions/Project and AWS describes this control as “not applicable”, as
      PIV credentials are not applicable to the Project system. Access and Authentication
      requirements for the Project system for internal CivicActions and customer are
      implemented under access management and enforcement (AC-2 and AC-3) and identification
      and authentication for all users (IA-2 and IA-8).


      It is the responsibility of CivicActions for implementation of PIV capability
      for authentication as required.
